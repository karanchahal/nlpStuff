## What is Chinking, we chink something from a chunk actually
# so basically we want to chunking everything except something




# What is chunking?

# you might have mnay nouns in a sentence ,that is we have a sentence and there are a lot of things in a sentence
# no nessesarily talking about eh same topic

## putting same code as speech tagging
