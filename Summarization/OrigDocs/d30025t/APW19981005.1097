RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stocks dropped sharplyMonday in the lowest trading volume of the year despite the almostcertain re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo Bovespa, lost 4.5percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange fell 3.4percent.Although Cardoso seems to have clinched a first-round win,investors feared that he would put off any announcement of theharsh economic measures deemed necessary until the second round ofvoting for a number of governors, senators and federal deputiestakes place on Oct. 25.``Cardoso has won in the first round, but the market is thinkingthat all the measures we are waiting for will only take place afterthe second round,'' said Fabio Lara, director at Schahin Curybrokerage in Sao Paulo.Lara said that the Cardoso government doesn't want to announceanything detrimental _ such as tax increases _ to its alliedcandidates in the state governments until they are through thesecond round of voting.
