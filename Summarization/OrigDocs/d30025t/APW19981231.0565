	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ This time around, the presidential
Rolls Royce is staying in the garage. And forget about champagne,
the inauguration will be toasted with locally-grown sparkling wine
and contraband whiskey seized by customs officials.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso prepares to be sworn in to a
second term in office Friday, but for many here the expectations
are as stripped down as the commemorations.
	   ``The difference in sentiment between the first term and the
second term are enormous,'' said Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman
and former finance minister, ``In 1995 everything was certainty and
hope ... the beginning of the second term is sadder: everything is
uncertainty.''
	   On the eve of his 1995 inauguration, Cardoso enjoyed approval
ratings of around 70 percent, almost entirely on the strength of
the economic plan he devised as finance minister under
then-President Itamar Franco.
	   Introduced in July 1994, the plan dropped inflation, then
hovering around 50 percent a month, to a single digit almost
overnight.
	   Suddenly one US dollar bought only 82 centavos of a real _ the
local currency _ and for many Brazilians, beaten down by years of
triple digit inflation, it was a heady time.
	   With new hard currency in their wallets, Brazilians traveled
abroad in record numbers and consumption of electronics and other
goods grew so quickly there were concerns the economy was
overheating.
	   It was in this climate that Cardoso was overwhelming elected in
Oct. 1995 and fittingly all the stops were pulled out for his first
inauguration with some 6,000 people attending the 3 million real
(dlrs 2.5 million) gala.
	   The economic plan received high marks from most economists, but
many warned that it would at best provide a window of opportunity
in which to address deep-seated structural problems.
	   Cardoso's government proposed constitutional amendments to
change the tax system, the pension system and civil service
payrolls and shore-up the country's burgeoning deficit.
	   But aside from a constitutional amendment that allowed the
president and governors to stand for reelection, something
prohibited under the country's 1988 Constitution, the other reforms
languished in Congress.
	   For a while, that wasn't a problem.
	   Trade and public sector deficits continue to grow, but foreign
money was flooding into Brazil faster than ever and the country's
reserves swelled from around dlrs 40 billion to above dlrs 70
billion during Cardoso's first three and a half years in office.
	   The volume on Brazilian stock exchanges more than doubled and
leading stock funds boasted returns of over 200 percent a year.
	   But when financial instability rocked Asia and then Russia last
August, the same foreign investment that had swelled the country's
foreign reserves left even faster than it came in.
	   With a dlrs 41.5 International Monetary Fund-led bailout
package, Brazil may have avoided becoming the latest domino to fall
in the financial crisis afflicting Asia and Russia, but the outcome
of all the fiscal belt-tightening needed to qualify for that aid
will almost certainly spell recession in 1999.
	   Although Cardoso soundly defeated his opponent, leftist Worker's
Party candidate Luiz Lula Inacio da Silva, in the first round of
last year's October election, his approval rating has sunk by some
17 percentage points in the months since then to around 35 percent.
	   According to a recent poll by the Datafolha organization, 48
percent of those questioned now expect inflation to rise over the
coming months and 66 percent are worried about losing their jobs.
	   The poll which interviewed 11,851 people had a margin of error
of plus or minus two percentage points.
	   Not surprisingly, Friday's inauguration dinner will be a
scaled-down affair.
	   Only 114 people are expected to attend the dinner following
Friday's inauguration which is expected to cost 60,000 reals (dlrs
50,000), or a mere 2 percent of what the first one cost.
	   Whether Cardoso will be able to steer Brazil _ and an unruly
Congress _ away from these uncertain shores is anybody's guess, but
regardless of what Brazilians think of the job he's doing they're
sticking by their captain.
	   ``He got us into this mess, so we'll just have to hope he can
get us out,'' said Luis Fernando Duarte de Morares, an agricultural
engineer.
