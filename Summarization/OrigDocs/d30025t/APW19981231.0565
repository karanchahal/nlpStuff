RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ This time around, the presidentialRolls Royce is staying in the garage. And forget about champagne,the inauguration will be toasted with locally-grown sparkling wineand contraband whiskey seized by customs officials.President Fernando Henrique Cardoso prepares to be sworn in to asecond term in office Friday, but for many here the expectationsare as stripped down as the commemorations.``The difference in sentiment between the first term and thesecond term are enormous,'' said Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressmanand former finance minister, ``In 1995 everything was certainty andhope ... the beginning of the second term is sadder: everything isuncertainty.''On the eve of his 1995 inauguration, Cardoso enjoyed approvalratings of around 70 percent, almost entirely on the strength ofthe economic plan he devised as finance minister underthen-President Itamar Franco.Introduced in July 1994, the plan dropped inflation, thenhovering around 50 percent a month, to a single digit almostovernight.Suddenly one US dollar bought only 82 centavos of a real _ thelocal currency _ and for many Brazilians, beaten down by years oftriple digit inflation, it was a heady time.With new hard currency in their wallets, Brazilians traveledabroad in record numbers and consumption of electronics and othergoods grew so quickly there were concerns the economy wasoverheating.It was in this climate that Cardoso was overwhelming elected inOct. 1995 and fittingly all the stops were pulled out for his firstinauguration with some 6,000 people attending the 3 million real(dlrs 2.5 million) gala.The economic plan received high marks from most economists, butmany warned that it would at best provide a window of opportunityin which to address deep-seated structural problems.Cardoso's government proposed constitutional amendments tochange the tax system, the pension system and civil servicepayrolls and shore-up the country's burgeoning deficit.But aside from a constitutional amendment that allowed thepresident and governors to stand for reelection, somethingprohibited under the country's 1988 Constitution, the other reformslanguished in Congress.For a while, that wasn't a problem.Trade and public sector deficits continue to grow, but foreignmoney was flooding into Brazil faster than ever and the country'sreserves swelled from around dlrs 40 billion to above dlrs 70billion during Cardoso's first three and a half years in office.The volume on Brazilian stock exchanges more than doubled andleading stock funds boasted returns of over 200 percent a year.But when financial instability rocked Asia and then Russia lastAugust, the same foreign investment that had swelled the country'sforeign reserves left even faster than it came in.With a dlrs 41.5 International Monetary Fund-led bailoutpackage, Brazil may have avoided becoming the latest domino to fallin the financial crisis afflicting Asia and Russia, but the outcomeof all the fiscal belt-tightening needed to qualify for that aidwill almost certainly spell recession in 1999.Although Cardoso soundly defeated his opponent, leftist Worker'sParty candidate Luiz Lula Inacio da Silva, in the first round oflast year's October election, his approval rating has sunk by some17 percentage points in the months since then to around 35 percent.According to a recent poll by the Datafolha organization, 48percent of those questioned now expect inflation to rise over thecoming months and 66 percent are worried about losing their jobs.The poll which interviewed 11,851 people had a margin of errorof plus or minus two percentage points.Not surprisingly, Friday's inauguration dinner will be ascaled-down affair.Only 114 people are expected to attend the dinner followingFriday's inauguration which is expected to cost 60,000 reals (dlrs50,000), or a mere 2 percent of what the first one cost.Whether Cardoso will be able to steer Brazil _ and an unrulyCongress _ away from these uncertain shores is anybody's guess, butregardless of what Brazilians think of the job he's doing they'resticking by their captain.``He got us into this mess, so we'll just have to hope he canget us out,'' said Luis Fernando Duarte de Morares, an agriculturalengineer.
