 
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian government, which
recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion in
an urgent attempt to boost its economic credibility, has released
new budget figures that show the true reduction will run about half
the promised amount.
 
 
   Total spending would actually increase next year.
 
 
   The original spending cuts, announced two weeks ago, were part
of an anxiously awaited program to raise government revenues next
year by $23.5 billion, and represented Brazil's commitment to
fiscal house cleaning and to shrinking its dangerously high budget
deficit.
 
 
   The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loan
from the International Monetary Fund and other sources, including
the U.S. government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage from
Brazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.
 
 
   The Clinton administration is concerned that a default in Brazil
_ the world's ninth-largest economy and home to more than half of
South America's 300 million people _ could trigger repercussions
around Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of U.S.
exports.
 
 
   With the IMF aid package expected to be announced within days,
the revised 1999 budget sent to Congress on Monday suggests that
Brazil may have overstated the level of actual government savings,
and it raised questions about the true size of the government's
effort.
  
   Planning Minister Paulo Paiva and Martus Tavares, the
government's executive secretary, could not be reached for comment.
 
 
   David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of
Brasilia and president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency
International, said the spending cuts were designed to restore
confidence abroad with a show of discipline that is partly
illusion. ``Maybe about half the savings is real,'' Fleischer said.
``The other half is pre-packed fat. They stuffed it all in the
budget in late August.''
 
 
   The figure of $7 billion in budget cuts is not entirely without
foundation. But it is based on savings from a generous 1999 budget
that, from the moment it was released in August, was acknowledged
to be unrealistically optimistic.
 
 
   The budget projected 4 percent economic expansion for 1999, just
after Brazil had doubled the ceiling on interest rates to almost 50
percent, to counter a $1 billion a day flight of dollar reserves
from the country after the Russian collapse.
 
 
   Soon after it was released, the government conceded that the
economy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year,
and some independent economists predict a more severe recession,
noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply of
capital for private industry.
 
 
   Compared to this year's spending, the government's budget for
next year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings on
discretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.
The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion on
discretionary expenses, which include a range of programs,
including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basic
sanitation.
 
 
   But the Brazilian government's overall budget, because of
court-ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase
$1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims to
austerity.
 
 
   Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of the
Rio-based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil is
on the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by its
current response to the crisis. Even before this week's details
appeared, economists criticized the Government for relying heavily
on taxes increases and pension dues to raise more than half the
promised revenues.
 
 
   The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is already
fighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austerity
package a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.
 
 
   ''When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually have
to do more than enough to win back confidence,'' Castro said.
``What came out of 1999 budget was slightly less than enough.''
 
 
   Alexandre Barros, a political scientist and consultant in
Brasilia, said he believed the big question surrounding Brazil was
not so much the size of the cuts made now, but the government's
ability to sustain lean spending practices over time.
 
 
   ''What I want to see is down the road,'' Barros said. ``What
happens after three or six months as the immediate pressures
recede, and people say, `Okay, Mr. President, why don't you revoke
this or that austerity measure?'''
