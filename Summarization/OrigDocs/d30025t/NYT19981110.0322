RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian government, whichrecently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion inan urgent attempt to boost its economic credibility, has releasednew budget figures that show the true reduction will run about halfthe promised amount.Total spending would actually increase next year.The original spending cuts, announced two weeks ago, were partof an anxiously awaited program to raise government revenues nextyear by $23.5 billion, and represented Brazil's commitment tofiscal house cleaning and to shrinking its dangerously high budgetdeficit.The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loanfrom the International Monetary Fund and other sources, includingthe U.S. government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage fromBrazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.The Clinton administration is concerned that a default in Brazil_ the world's ninth-largest economy and home to more than half ofSouth America's 300 million people _ could trigger repercussionsaround Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of U.S.exports.With the IMF aid package expected to be announced within days,the revised 1999 budget sent to Congress on Monday suggests thatBrazil may have overstated the level of actual government savings,and it raised questions about the true size of the government'seffort.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Planning Minister Paulo Paiva and Martus Tavares, thegovernment's executive secretary, could not be reached for comment.David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University ofBrasilia and president of the Brazilian chapter of TransparencyInternational, said the spending cuts were designed to restoreconfidence abroad with a show of discipline that is partlyillusion. ``Maybe about half the savings is real,'' Fleischer said.``The other half is pre-packed fat. They stuffed it all in thebudget in late August.''The figure of $7 billion in budget cuts is not entirely withoutfoundation. But it is based on savings from a generous 1999 budgetthat, from the moment it was released in August, was acknowledgedto be unrealistically optimistic.The budget projected 4 percent economic expansion for 1999, justafter Brazil had doubled the ceiling on interest rates to almost 50percent, to counter a $1 billion a day flight of dollar reservesfrom the country after the Russian collapse.Soon after it was released, the government conceded that theeconomy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year,and some independent economists predict a more severe recession,noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply ofcapital for private industry.Compared to this year's spending, the government's budget fornext year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings ondiscretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion ondiscretionary expenses, which include a range of programs,including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basicsanitation.But the Brazilian government's overall budget, because ofcourt-ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase$1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims toausterity.Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of theRio-based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil ison the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by itscurrent response to the crisis. Even before this week's detailsappeared, economists criticized the Government for relying heavilyon taxes increases and pension dues to raise more than half thepromised revenues.The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is alreadyfighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austeritypackage a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.''When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually haveto do more than enough to win back confidence,'' Castro said.``What came out of 1999 budget was slightly less than enough.''Alexandre Barros, a political scientist and consultant inBrasilia, said he believed the big question surrounding Brazil wasnot so much the size of the cuts made now, but the government'sability to sustain lean spending practices over time.''What I want to see is down the road,'' Barros said. ``Whathappens after three or six months as the immediate pressuresrecede, and people say, `Okay, Mr. President, why don't you revokethis or that austerity measure?'''
