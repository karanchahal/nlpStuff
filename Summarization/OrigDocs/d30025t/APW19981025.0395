RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With President Fernando HenriqueCardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for Brazil,voters went to the polls Sunday to elect governors in 12 states andthe Federal District of Brasilia.Voting was calm after polls opened at 8 a.m. (1000 GMT), showinglittle of the illegal but last-minute campaigning that pervaded thefirst-round election on Oct. 4. Even so, army troops were deployedat voting stations in four northern states to ensure peace.The austerity plan was very much on the minds of the 64 millionBrazilians expected to vote. Paulo Garrini, a businessadministration student in Sao Paulo, said it was one reason hevoted for incumbent Gov. Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally.``Covas made it clear he will support Cardoso in the austeritymeasures the country needs, no matter how painful they may be,''Garrini said.But many voters are indifferent, believing that hard times areahead _ no matter what their choice at the polls.Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a yearago in Southeast Asia, Brazil believes it needs to slash governmentspending and raise taxes quickly to shore up its flagging economyand restore investor confidence.The difficulty, however, of pushing through such unpopularmeasures at election time became evident when Cardoso repeatedlyput off announcing the austerity package. Such measures wereinitially expected after first-round elections, in which Cardosowas re-elected and 14 state governors were chosen.After the election, Cardoso said the package could be announcedby Oct. 20. But with 13 government-allied candidates facing toughrun-offs, he postponed it until after the Oct. 25 second-roundelections.David Fleischer, a professor of political science at theUniversity of Brasilia said it was a smart move on the president'spart.``Governors have far more power and a direct hold on theirstates than the president has over the whole country,'' saidFleischer. ``Their influence and political weight should not beunderestimated.''Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is tocurb their overspending, which accounts for a big chunk of thegovernment's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, thesituation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso allies in Brazil'sfour most developed states _ Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, MinasGerais and Rio Grande do Sul.In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse withmore than 34 million inhabitants, Covas came from behind in thepolls to pass Paulo Maluf, a populist candidate with a taste forextravagant public works projects.In Rio de Janeiro, polls put opposition candidate AnthonyGarotinho well ahead of Cardoso ally Cesar Maia.``Whoever wins, it's going to be difficult because it doesn'tlook like there's going to be much money to spend,'' said PauloBenevides, a 22-year-old college student. He said he planned tovote for Maia, Rio's mayor.
