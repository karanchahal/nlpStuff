RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters appeared to re-electPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the first round of ballotingSunday, thus maintaining the leadership of a country strugglingagainst economic crisis.In preliminary returns, Cardoso appeared to have defeated LuizInacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential candidate of theleftist Workers Party, with 56 percent of the vote, a far strongershowing than polls initially predicted.Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in BrasiliaSunday night called the vote a mandate for reform, which thepresident is under national and international pressure to carryout.With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves sinceRussia's economic collapse in late August, and the Sao Paulo stockmarket down more than 40 percent this year, the Braziliangovernment has been somewhat paralyzed by the approach ofelections. It has been negotiating a bailout with the InternationalMonetary Fund, but has been unable to show progress on structuralreforms that would cut government expenses over the long term.But the waiting is probably not over yet. The size of hisvictory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitivesocial security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. But,political analysts said, Congress will probably not convene toconsider painful economic reforms before important gubernatorialrunoffs on Oct. 25.With policy-makers at the meetings of the Group of Seven topindustrialized nations and the International Monetary Fund inWashington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the volatilitythat is threatening Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia,Cardoso is expected to start taking steps to put Brazil's accountsin order.Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor atCatholic University and chief of population studies at theBrazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, said he did notexpect that Cardoso could make progress toward restructuring thegovernment before Oct. 25, because these measures would requirelegislative approval.``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level tocut costs, or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at PrudentialSecurities, said that financial markets were not expecting concretereforms from Brazil in the next few weeks.``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whetherthere is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil andwhether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on thebudget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they'removing in the right direction, it will begin to calm financialmarkets.''Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half thecountry voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly votershad trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to endbefore polls opened, most candidates appeared to ignore theprohibition.At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slumin South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-sized photos ofcandidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air andcarpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast theirvotes, with many supporting Cardoso for re-election.Luiz Claudio Silveira, a 34-year-old horse trainer, said heplanned to vote for Cardoso, largely because he ended inflation.``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy whatever you neednow,'' he said. ``Four years is not enough to change a country asbig as ours. I really believe in him.''Rute Vicente Oliveira, a 48-year-old manicurist, also planned tovote for Cardoso. She said that for most of her life, her familylived in a lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. It was herfather's dream, she said, and he died before it was realized.``Now, the house is almost done, it's almost completely in order,''she said.Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, saidthat he expected the economic adjustments that Cardoso announcedwould hurt him personally, but he was prepared to sacrifice inorder to stabilize Brazil's economy.``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country,'' daSilva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will get better.''
