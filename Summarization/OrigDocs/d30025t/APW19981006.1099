	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Attention has shifted in Brazil from
the president's almost-certain re-election to gubernatorial runoff
elections, on which the success of belt tightening measures deemed
necessary to avert an economic meltdown may hinge.
	   With 69.5 percent of the votes counted Tuesday, President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso Cardoso continued to lead with 52.4
percent of the vote. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
of the leftist Workers Party had 32.6 percent, and Ciro Gomes of
the Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent.
	   Nine other candidates shared the rest. Cardoso must win more
than half the vote from Sunday's election to avoid a second-round
runoff _ a feat he is expected to easily accomplish.
	   The same rule applies to the gubernatorial candidates in all 27
states, and at least 14 of them appeared headed to a second round
of voting on Oct.25.
	   ``Governors have always exerted enormous influence on their
states' congressional bloc,'' said Luciano Dias a Brasilia-based
political consultant. ``And the outcome of the runoff elections
will definitely determine just how easy, or difficult, it will be
for Cardoso to persuade Congress to approve the austerity
measures.''
	   He said that if Cardoso opponents win runoff elections in the
states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do
Sul, ``the going will get tough.''
	   Together, those four states occupy 200 of the 513 seats in the
Chamber of Deputies and account for 67.29 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.
	   ``If the opposition wins in these states Cardoso will face a
formidable wall of resistance against the unpopular measures that
are certain to come,'' Dias said. ``The president will get his
measures, but he will have to negotiate, and that means bartering,
which could weaken the austerity package.''
	   Brazil, like other emerging markets, is suffering from a loss of
investor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country's
foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70
billion posted at the end of July.
	   To prevent a collapse of the real and stem capital flight,
interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. Cardoso has
promised to tackle the country's ballooning a budget deficit _
equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ and hinted that
taxes would be increased.
	   Although most observers agree that the faster these measures are
defined and introduced, the better, Cardoso is unlikely to impose
them until after the second round of voting. To do so would
jeopardize the chances of pro-government gubernatorial candidates.
	   Chip Brown, chief Latin American economist for Salomon Smith
Barney in New York, said that little news was expected over the
next few weeks on the fiscal package meant to restore confidence
among investors.
	   ``I hope the market doesn't expect too much immediately,'' he
said, adding that the best markets can hope for in the short term
is broad sketches of a fiscal plan.
	   Ricardo Ribeiro, a Sao Paulo political consultant, said delaying
the measures could make their approval more difficult.
	   ``As the population gets a better notion of the seriousness of
the crisis and the severity of the measures that will certainly be
adopted, Cardoso's popularity will erode,'' he said. ``And if his
popularity drops, so will his chances to get Congress' approval for
these measures.''
