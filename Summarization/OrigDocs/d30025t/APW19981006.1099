SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Attention has shifted in Brazil fromthe president's almost-certain re-election to gubernatorial runoffelections, on which the success of belt tightening measures deemednecessary to avert an economic meltdown may hinge.With 69.5 percent of the votes counted Tuesday, PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso Cardoso continued to lead with 52.4percent of the vote. His closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvaof the leftist Workers Party had 32.6 percent, and Ciro Gomes ofthe Popular Socialist Party had 11 percent.Nine other candidates shared the rest. Cardoso must win morethan half the vote from Sunday's election to avoid a second-roundrunoff _ a feat he is expected to easily accomplish.The same rule applies to the gubernatorial candidates in all 27states, and at least 14 of them appeared headed to a second roundof voting on Oct.25.``Governors have always exerted enormous influence on theirstates' congressional bloc,'' said Luciano Dias a Brasilia-basedpolitical consultant. ``And the outcome of the runoff electionswill definitely determine just how easy, or difficult, it will befor Cardoso to persuade Congress to approve the austeritymeasures.''He said that if Cardoso opponents win runoff elections in thestates of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande doSul, ``the going will get tough.''Together, those four states occupy 200 of the 513 seats in theChamber of Deputies and account for 67.29 percent of the country'sgross domestic product.``If the opposition wins in these states Cardoso will face aformidable wall of resistance against the unpopular measures thatare certain to come,'' Dias said. ``The president will get hismeasures, but he will have to negotiate, and that means bartering,which could weaken the austerity package.''Brazil, like other emerging markets, is suffering from a loss ofinvestor confidence and a strong outflow of capital. The country'sforeign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from the dlrs 70billion posted at the end of July.To prevent a collapse of the real and stem capital flight,interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year. Cardoso haspromised to tackle the country's ballooning a budget deficit _equal to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product _ and hinted thattaxes would be increased.Although most observers agree that the faster these measures aredefined and introduced, the better, Cardoso is unlikely to imposethem until after the second round of voting. To do so wouldjeopardize the chances of pro-government gubernatorial candidates.Chip Brown, chief Latin American economist for Salomon SmithBarney in New York, said that little news was expected over thenext few weeks on the fiscal package meant to restore confidenceamong investors.``I hope the market doesn't expect too much immediately,'' hesaid, adding that the best markets can hope for in the short termis broad sketches of a fiscal plan.Ricardo Ribeiro, a Sao Paulo political consultant, said delayingthe measures could make their approval more difficult.``As the population gets a better notion of the seriousness ofthe crisis and the severity of the measures that will certainly beadopted, Cardoso's popularity will erode,'' he said. ``And if hispopularity drops, so will his chances to get Congress' approval forthese measures.''
