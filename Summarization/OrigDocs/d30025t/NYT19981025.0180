RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Rivals of President Fernando HenriqueCardoso won important victories in gubernatorial races Sunday,handing the recently re-elected president a complex landscape forpushing through long-delayed government and economic reforms.In Sao Paulo, however, Brazil's most populous and wealthieststate, Mario Covas appeared likely to win re-election as governor,defeating former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf.Although Maluf's party forms part of the president's governingcoalition, Cardoso had endorsed Covas. Maluf is known as a bigspender with presidential ambitions of his own. His victory couldhave complicated Cardoso's efforts to control state spending andwin congressional approval for reforms.Despite considerable foreign pressure on Brazil to demonstratehow it will restructure government to reduce deficits, Cardoso hasput off publicly announcing his plans, fearing they could damagethe chances of his allies in the elections. The delay costs Brazilheavily; each day, the country loses hundreds of billions ofdollars in foreign reserves, and the longer the country maintainsinterest rates over 40 percent, the deeper its recession and debt.With Brazil's solvency seen as crucial to maintaining economicstability of Latin America and protecting the United States fromrecession, the United States and the International Monetary Fundare preparing to chip in toward an aid package of at least $30billion to shore up Brazil.Cardoso won re-election on the first round of national votingearlier this month, but partial results showed left-of-centercandidates leading in some of the most developed states of Brazil.Sen. Pedro Piva, of the president's Brazilian Social DemocracyParty, called Sunday's elections ``a warning sign for thegovernment,'' adding, ``I think we're going to have difficultiesahead to approve this package.''The governors are important both because they control aconsiderable share of the national budget and act as naturalleaders of their parties in Congress. States will be called upon tocut their budgets by as much as 20 to 30 percent, which will meanlaying off civil servants. Current laws allow the states to fireworkers if the payroll exceeds 60 percent of the state budget;under a new law the administration is proposing, layoffs wouldbecome mandatory once that ceiling was reached.In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former mayor of the cityof Campos who belongs to the leftist Democratic Workers Party, wasleading over Cesar Maia, a former Rio mayor belonging to aconservative grouping.In Rio Grande do Sul in the south, Olivio Dutra of the Workers'Party was also leading over the incumbent, Antonio Britto, aCardoso ally.In Minas Gerais, former President Itamar Franco was leading by awide margin over the incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, also of Cardoso'scentrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Franco's party belongsto the governing coalition, but Franco has been critical ofCardoso's economic policies and personally stung by the president'sre-election.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)In 1993, during Franco's presidency, he named Cardoso financeminister and launched the economic plan that would make Cardoso anational hero to a people weary of hyperinflation. But Franco wasdeeply humiliated at his party's convention earlier this year, whenhe sought to run for president against Cardoso. He was not onlyturned down, but laughed at.Sunday night, Sen. Maguito Vilela, of Franco's BrazilianDemocratic Movement Party, said backing for Cardoso's reforms wouldnot be automatic. The party would not support tax increases, hesaid, noting that one tax slated for increase, on financialtransfers, was initially approved as a temporary measure to financehospitals, but ended up going to offset the deficit. ``It justburdened people and didn't do anything to improve health care,'' hesaid.Asked on Brazilian television precisely which measures his partywould endorse, Vilela said, ``If it means more sacrifice for thepeople,'' his party ``will not support it.''
