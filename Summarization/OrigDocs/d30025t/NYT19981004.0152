RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters gave PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round ofballoting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of acountry struggling against economic crisis.With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to havewon 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his mainrival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidentialcandidate of the leftist Workers Party.If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardosowill be declared re-elected without facing a runoff. Exit pollsindicated that he might win as much as 56 percent.Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in BrasiliaSunday night called the vote a mandate for the economic measuresthat the president is under national and international pressure tocarry out.With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves sinceRussia's economic collapse in late August, and with the Sao Paulostock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Braziliangovernment has been close to paralyzed by the approach of theelection.It has been negotiating a bailout with the InternationalMonetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structuralchanges that would cut government expenses over the long term.The waiting is probably not over yet, though. The size of hisvictory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitivesocial security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. Butpolitical analysts said Congress would probably not convene toconsider the painful economic measures before importantgubernatorial runoffs on Oct. 25 because the legislators will bebusy campaigning for their parties' gubernatorial candidates.With policy-makers at meetings of the Group of Seven industrialnations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seekingpermanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threateningBrazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is underconsiderable pressure to put Brazil's accounts in order.But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at PrudentialSecurities in New York, said the international financial marketswere not necessarily expecting major changes from Brazil in thenext few weeks.``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whetherthere is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, andwhether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on thebudget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they'removing in the right direction, it will begin to calm financialmarkets.''Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor atCatholic University in Rio de Janeiro and chief of populationstudies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics,said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress towardrestructuring the government before Oct. 25, because such measureswould require legislative approval.``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level tocut costs or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half of thecountry voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly votershad trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to endbefore polls opened Sunday, most candidates appeared to ignore theprohibition.At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slumin South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-size photos ofcandidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air andcarpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast theirvotes, with many supporting Cardoso.Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha,said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because the presidenthad ended inflation. ``If you go to the supermarket, you can buywhatever you need now,'' Silveira said. ``Four years is not enoughto change a country as big as ours. I really believe in him.''Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to votefor Cardoso. For most of her life, she said, her family lived in alean-to, too poor to build a proper home. Her father dreamed ofgiving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms. Oliveira said, but hedied before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.``Now the house is almost done,'' she said. ``It's almostcompletely in order.''Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustmentsahead, though the president announced less than two weeks beforethe election that government belt-tightening measures would beinevitable. Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote Sunday,nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education,and 35 percent are barely literate.Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, saidthat he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personallybut that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil'seconomy. The president said he would cut government costs, crackdown on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increaserevenues.``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than ofmyself,'' da Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation willget better.''
