 
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Through the anxious weeks leading up to
the national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fled
Brazil despite the doubling of domestic interest rates,
international financial officials watched for the government to
tackle cost-cutting reforms as soon as voting ended.
 
 
   But Monday, as official returns indicated President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re-election and
governors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month,
the road to reform is looming longer and more complex. Polling
groups and television stations that reported an overwhelming
victory for Cardoso came under severe criticism.
 
 
   Though exit polls reported Cardoso taking some 56 percent of the
vote, official tallies Monday afternoon gave him 51 percent, with
56 percent of the votes counted. His nearest rival, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent,
substantially higher than the 24 percent polls predicted he would
take. Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percent higher than needed to
avoid a second round of balloting.
 
 
   Ciro Gomes, an up-and-coming former finance minister from the
northeastern state of Ceara, took 11 percent, while Eneas Carneiro,
a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained
2.2 percent of the vote. Though voting in Brazil is largely
obligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30
percent.
 
 
   Allies of the president did poorly in many of Brazil's most
populous and politically influential states, weakening Cardoso's
hand going into negotiations for reform.
 
 
   Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilian
officials have been in Washington negotiating some form of
assistance from the International Monetary Fund that will likely
total $30 billion or more.
 
 
   The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas _ social
security and civil service _ and to simplify and improve tax
collection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at a
time when investors generally are fleeing emerging markets.
 
 
   Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of Gross National
Product, and its current account deficit, which includes its
balance of trade as well as debt service and other payments,
constitutes more than 4 percent of GNP. Government cutbacks of $5
billion, and the doubling of interbank loan rates to almost 50
percent, have slowed but not stopped the flight of capital. As of 6
p.m. Monday, some $300 million had left foreign reserve coffers,
and the Sao Paulo stock market was down 4.47 percent.
 
 
   Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from the
government and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.
 
 
   But the political arena remained strangely silent Monday, almost
suspended. By Monday afternoon, Cardoso still had not claimed
victory, and da Silva had not conceded defeat. Sergio Amaral, the
president's spokesman, said Cardoso would wait until official
results were completely tallied before speaking.
 
 
   Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit polls
showing the president doing vastly better than official tallies
bore out, and in state races, polling institutes by and large
underplayed the strength of leftist candidates, bringing them under
sharp attack.
 
 
   ``The nation has watched the most shameful political and
electoral manipulation heard of in recent history,'' said a
statement from the coalition of parties that da Silva represented.
It accused the polling institutes, media, and electoral officials
of conspiring ``to influence public opinion and alter the electoral
will.''
 
 
   Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls for
Datafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentional
manipulation of the results. He predicted the final results would
support the exit polls. While it is illegal to announce exit poll
results while voting is still going on, it is ``traditional'' in
Brazil, he said.
 
 
   Brazil's Congress, out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates,
will likely not convene to consider reforms before the end of the
month, however dire the international situation. Cardoso appears to
be planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a brief
vacation and a trip to Portugal coming up. He is not expected to
openly campaign for any candidates.
 
 
   Maria Dalvo Kinzo, a political scientist at the University of
Sao Paulo, said the only factor that might make pushing reforms
easier for the president this time is the urgency of the crisis.
``There's a consciousness that the crisis is very serious,'' Ms.
Kinzo said.
 
 
   But she warned that with the strong showings of leftist
candidates in important state races, and with half the deputies
newcomers to Congress, the president's governing coalition was
appearing more fragmented. ``Now, he's going to have to really
patch together support,'' she said.
 
 
   Jose Augusto Guilhermo de Albuquerque, coordinator of the
research center on international relations at the University of Sao
Paulo, agreed. ``His coalition will be larger and less
ideologically committed than the current one,'' Albuquerque said.
Party discipline, customarily half-hearted, will be even weaker in
the new panorama, he added.
