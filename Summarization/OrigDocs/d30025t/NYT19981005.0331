RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Through the anxious weeks leading up tothe national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fledBrazil despite the doubling of domestic interest rates,international financial officials watched for the government totackle cost-cutting reforms as soon as voting ended.But Monday, as official returns indicated President FernandoHenrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re-election andgovernors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month,the road to reform is looming longer and more complex. Pollinggroups and television stations that reported an overwhelmingvictory for Cardoso came under severe criticism.Though exit polls reported Cardoso taking some 56 percent of thevote, official tallies Monday afternoon gave him 51 percent, with56 percent of the votes counted. His nearest rival, Luiz InacioLula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent,substantially higher than the 24 percent polls predicted he wouldtake. Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percent higher than needed toavoid a second round of balloting.Ciro Gomes, an up-and-coming former finance minister from thenortheastern state of Ceara, took 11 percent, while Eneas Carneiro,a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained2.2 percent of the vote. Though voting in Brazil is largelyobligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30percent.Allies of the president did poorly in many of Brazil's mostpopulous and politically influential states, weakening Cardoso'shand going into negotiations for reform.Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilianofficials have been in Washington negotiating some form ofassistance from the International Monetary Fund that will likelytotal $30 billion or more.The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas _ socialsecurity and civil service _ and to simplify and improve taxcollection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at atime when investors generally are fleeing emerging markets.Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of Gross NationalProduct, and its current account deficit, which includes itsbalance of trade as well as debt service and other payments,constitutes more than 4 percent of GNP. Government cutbacks of $5billion, and the doubling of interbank loan rates to almost 50percent, have slowed but not stopped the flight of capital. As of 6p.m. Monday, some $300 million had left foreign reserve coffers,and the Sao Paulo stock market was down 4.47 percent.Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from thegovernment and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.But the political arena remained strangely silent Monday, almostsuspended. By Monday afternoon, Cardoso still had not claimedvictory, and da Silva had not conceded defeat. Sergio Amaral, thepresident's spokesman, said Cardoso would wait until officialresults were completely tallied before speaking.Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit pollsshowing the president doing vastly better than official talliesbore out, and in state races, polling institutes by and largeunderplayed the strength of leftist candidates, bringing them undersharp attack.``The nation has watched the most shameful political andelectoral manipulation heard of in recent history,'' said astatement from the coalition of parties that da Silva represented.It accused the polling institutes, media, and electoral officialsof conspiring ``to influence public opinion and alter the electoralwill.''Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls forDatafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentionalmanipulation of the results. He predicted the final results wouldsupport the exit polls. While it is illegal to announce exit pollresults while voting is still going on, it is ``traditional'' inBrazil, he said.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Brazil's Congress, out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates,will likely not convene to consider reforms before the end of themonth, however dire the international situation. Cardoso appears tobe planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a briefvacation and a trip to Portugal coming up. He is not expected toopenly campaign for any candidates.Maria Dalvo Kinzo, a political scientist at the University ofSao Paulo, said the only factor that might make pushing reformseasier for the president this time is the urgency of the crisis.``There's a consciousness that the crisis is very serious,'' Ms.Kinzo said.But she warned that with the strong showings of leftistcandidates in important state races, and with half the deputiesnewcomers to Congress, the president's governing coalition wasappearing more fragmented. ``Now, he's going to have to reallypatch together support,'' she said.Jose Augusto Guilhermo de Albuquerque, coordinator of theresearch center on international relations at the University of SaoPaulo, agreed. ``His coalition will be larger and lessideologically committed than the current one,'' Albuquerque said.Party discipline, customarily half-hearted, will be even weaker inthe new panorama, he added.
