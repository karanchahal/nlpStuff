The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has little time tosavor his apparent first-round re-election victory Sunday. He musttake rapid and unpopular steps to save the economy.Brazilians voted for Cardoso because they trusted his economicmanagement more than that of his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula daSilva. da Silva, who leads the Workers Party, campaigned for a moreclosed economy. His prescriptions struck many Brazilians aswell-meaning but unrealistic. But Cardoso avoided a runoff by thesmallest of margins, and his allies failed to win in many importantstates. The new Congress, which will take office in February, islikely to be less cooperative than the current one.Brazil has made great economic strides under policies initiatedby Cardoso, first as finance minister and then as president.Inflation, a perennial problem, has fallen from 3,000 percent ayear to around zero. As the economy has grown, many Brazilians haveprospered.Much of that success came from a policy of tying the Braziliancurrency, the real, to the dollar, and allowing it to fall about 7percent a year. Unfortunately, it appears that the depreciationrate was not enough to keep up with economic realities. Brazil hasbeen running a large trade deficit as well as a big budget deficit.Now, with markets fearful, its debts have become crucial. More than$300 million a day is draining out of the country despite interestrates of 40 percent, which have stopped economic growth.Cardoso and the Congress must take fiscal discipline seriously.In May the Congress rejected his social security and civil servicereforms. Then he abandoned restraints during his election campaign,and spending soared. Now Congress must simplify taxes and improveincome tax collection rates _ especially crucial because thesetaxes will come from the better-off in a country with one of theworld's most unequal income distributions.Brazil must also control spending, especially on pensions forthe bloated public sector. Putting Brazil's finances in order willbe painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by comingup with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves. Butit must be contingent on Brazil's own reforms. It is unlikely,however, that the international community can find enough money tosupport the overvalued real forever. The real will probablyeventually have to be devalued, but it is understandable thatBrazilians, who remember hyperinflation, fear an immediate andperhaps uncontrolled devaluation.The perception now is that Latin America could go the way ofAsia if Brazil sinks, and such perceptions can create their ownproblems. There are good reasons for the world to help Brazil, butBrazil must also deal with its own problems.
