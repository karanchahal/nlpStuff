	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's women divers expect to clinch
Asian Games gold in the platform competition but could face stiff
competition from Kazakstan in the springboard.
	   ``If we make no big mistake, the gold should be ours,'' Chinese
platform diver Li Na said Sunday, on the eve of the start to the
diving competition.
	   The diminutive 14-year-old, competing in her first major
international competition, told China's state-run Xinhua News
Agency that she sees her 16-year-old teammate Cai Yuyan as her main
opponent in the platform.
	   But she acknowledged that Kazakstan's Irina Vyguzova could
challenge China in the women's three-meter springboard, Xinhua
said.
	   ``Irina is an excellent diver,'' said Li. ``If she gives her
best in the competition, she has the chance to snatch the gold away
from Chinese divers.''
	   Guo Jingjing and Yang Lan will represent China in the women's
springboard contest.
