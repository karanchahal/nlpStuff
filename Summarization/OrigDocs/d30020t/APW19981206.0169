BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's swim team will hit the water atthe Asian Games on Monday with a reminder of the darkest chapter inits story of drug shame.Xiong Gouming, one of the 11 Chinese athletes who testedpositive for steroids in Hiroshima four years ago, will compete inthe men's 400-meter individual medley, taking his place on a teamthat is constantly forced to defend itself.Head coach Zhang Xiong said Xiong Gouming ``feels fine'' aboutbeing back at an Asian Games. ``That was the past,'' said Zhang,brushing off drug questions Sunday. ``We hope that we will beclean.''The Chinese Olympic Committee tested athletes before theirdeparture for Bangkok, and Chinese media said the swimmers weresubjected to four surprise tests conducted by world governing bodyFINA.``We treat this as a major issue to make sure no Chineseathletes will test positive,'' COC vice president Li Furong said.Earlier this year China announced, through FINA, that any of itsathletes testing positive for steroids would be banned for life.Under those criteria, Xiong would never have had his second chanceat an Asian Games.Xiong won four golds in Hiroshima but has been mediocre sincereturning to international competition at the East Asian Games ayear ago. He was one of many poor performers at the worldchampionships in Perth in January, as the Chinese appeareddemoralized by yet another scandal.After female swimmer Yuan Yuan was caught trying to smuggle 13vials of human growth hormone through Sydney Airport, four of herteammates were nabbed with masking agents in their systems andthrown out of the games.Chinese women swimmers won 12 of the 16 golds at stake in the1994 Rome world championships and all 15 of their races in the 1994Asian Games.The team won three gold medals at this year's worldchampionships. Two of those went in the medley events to worldrecord holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, who will lead the Chineseteam here.Fellow world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong were leftoff a generally young squad assembled with a view ahead to the 2000Olympics.Japan's rising talent will test the inexperienced Chinese aftera successful world championships.Mai Nakamura, a silver medalist in the 100-meter backstroke andbronze medalist over 200; Ayari Aoyama, silver medalist in the100-meter butterfly, and Yasuko Tajima, bronze medalist in the400-meter medley, give the Japanese team undoubted class.&UR; (tjh)
