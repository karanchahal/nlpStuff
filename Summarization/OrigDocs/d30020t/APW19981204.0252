BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Once at the top of world field hockey,India would like to have a hockey god to help regain that glory.``Things are changing in Bangkok, and we are feeling muchbetter,'' Rajinder Singh, manager of the Indian hockey squad, saidFriday, a day after the Indians defeated Japan 3-2 in a warmupmatch for the Asian Games.The Indians, who number 980 million, have an amazing quality ofdiscovering gods who number in hundreds of thousands. There is evena goddess for small pox and Indians still pray to her to keep thatdisease, almost eradicated, away.``We believe in divine blessings and we hope it pours on us,''said Singh.There are so many ifs for the Indians on the way to a gold medalin the 12-nation tournament that it may well be luck besides skilland endurance needed to reach the top.In its glory days, skill helped India win a total of eightOlympic gold medals, the most recently in 1980. But the Indianshave won an Asian Games gold medal only once, silver eight timesand bronze once.The South Koreans, who have remained a force in field hockeysince winning the gold in the 1986 Asian Games at home, are clearlythe favorite.Between winning the last Asian Games gold in Hiroshima in 1994,the Koreans have figured in two World Cups, two Champions Trophyevents and the Atlanta Olympics.The Indians were silver medalists at Hiroshima, but since thenhave suffered a downward swing. They placed eighth at the 1996Olympics and one step lower in the Utrecht World Cup. At thisyear's Commonwealth Games, India was out of the medals.In Bangkok, however, there are some silver linings.Skipper Dhanraj Pillay is a passionate player and no defense issafe against him if he gets the ball properly. Baljit SinghDhillon, a specialist in flick-drives in goal-winning penaltycorners, has shaped up well.Pakistan, India's traditional rival in the subcontinent on manyissues besides sports, can also dampen the Indian hope for acomeback. Pakistan has won the Asian Games gold medal seven times,silver twice and bronze once.The other medalists at the Asians Games have been Malaysia withfive bronzes and Japan with two.&UR; (dg)
