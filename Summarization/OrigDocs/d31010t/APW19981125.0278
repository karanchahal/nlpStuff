WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Krzysztof Chmiel knows about beinghomeless and drinking, so his explanation for the 47 deaths as ofWednesday in Poland's Arctic cold wave sounds plausible.``They drink methylated spirit and then drop dead,'' said the46-year-old Chmiel, bundled up in a long, heavy coat at a Warsawhomeless shelter. ``Methylated spirit warms you up really quickly,but you also cool down quickly.''The frigid Arctic air that moved in last week has claimed morethan 90 lives across Europe, including 30 in Romania and some inFrance, Bulgaria and Italy. Croatia reported its first cold-relateddeath Wednesday, a woman who lived alone in an unheated house.Temperatures have dropped well below freezing, with minus 26Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit) recorded in Poland on Sunday.
