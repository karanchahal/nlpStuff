	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 62 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The early winter weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in
Romania and Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people
died, most of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold
after drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). The lowest
temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15 Fahrenheit)
early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents on snow-covered roads since Friday.
Temperatures plunged to 14 early today.
	   About 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways in southern
Romania. Army vehicles rescued most drivers but six people froze to
death over the weekend after being trapped in their cars.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the Libertatea newspaper reported
Monday. Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as
1.5 meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowy
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In France, the death toll from the cold snap rose Monday to six
people, three of them homeless men.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris were completely
frozen, and in Mouthe, in eastern France, temperatures fell Monday
morning to minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 F).
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed Monday due to storms, state radio reported.
