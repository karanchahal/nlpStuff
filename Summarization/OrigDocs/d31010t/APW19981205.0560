	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The death toll from almost three weeks of
sub-zero temperatures reached 85 on Saturday, after two men froze
to death in their unheated homes in northeastern Poland.
	   Both victims, ages 36 and 49, were from towns near the city of
Bialystok. Both drank alcohol before going to sleep, police said.
	   Poland's extreme cold began Nov. 16, with temperatures dropping
to minus 26 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). Police say the number of
cold-related deaths in recent weeks is 29 more than the number for
all of last winter.
	   Many of the victims were homeless, and most had been drinking
alcohol, which lowers the body temperature. On Friday, a man
identified as Adam S., 47, was found frozen to death in a Warsaw
park.
