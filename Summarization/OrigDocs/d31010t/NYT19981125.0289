 
   NATIONAL FORECAST 
 
 
   Inclement weather will affect parts of the Northeast on Thursday
as developing low pressure lifts Atlantic moisture across the
region. Wet snow will fall in northern Maine and on the high ground
of northern New Hampshire and Vermont. The snow will accumulate
several inches in some areas. Farther south, mixed precipitation
will turn to rain in central New England as breezes from the
southeast usher warmer air into the area. Periods of heavy rain
will fall in southern New England, punctuated by rumbles of
thunder.
 
 
   Morning showers will give way to drying breezes and breaking
clouds during the afternoon in the Middle Atlantic States. Indeed,
temperatures will remain mild in the wake of the storm system, as
Arctic chill remains north of the Canadian border.
 
 
   Sunshine and warmth will cover much of the Plains and Southeast.
Expansive high pressure centered over Arkansas will prompt readings
in the 60s and 70s from the western Dakotas to North Carolina.
Meanwhile, clouds and breezes from the northwest will keep the
Great Lakes States more seasonal.
 
 
   The relentless parade of Pacific storms will plague the
Northwest as pockets of cold air aloft rotate into the region.
Spates of gusty winds and heavy rain will accompany intense showers
in coastal areas. As the showers move into the Cascades, heavy snow
will fall above 3,000 feet. Lighter showers will fall in the
valleys east of the mountains.
 
 
   Elsewhere, the Southwest will remain mostly sunny and warm with
a few clouds in the mountains of Utah and Nevada.
 
 
   Focus: European Cold Wave
 
 
   On Sunday, snow whitened parts of Capri off the coast of
southern Italy, the Mediterranean islandUs first snowfall in ten
years. Meanwhile, as much as 16 inches of snow capped Mt. Vesuvius
as an unusually cold air mass invaded western Europe on chilly
winds from the east. Closer to the center of the frigid air mass,
temperatures plunged to minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit in Moscow on
Nov. 17, prompting Russian meteorologists to declare the
mid-November outbreak the coldest in 20 years. If steering winds
shift and blow across the North Pole from Russia, the chill would
invade Canada.
