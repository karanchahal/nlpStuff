cold front were found Thursday, raising the death toll from more
than two weeks of freezing temperatures to at least 74.
	   Police said a 40-year-old man was found frozen to death in
central Poland on Thursday morning. A second man was found
overnight in Elblag province in northern Poland, near Gdansk.

of last winter, police say.
