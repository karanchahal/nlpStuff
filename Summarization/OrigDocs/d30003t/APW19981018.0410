OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said Sunday hedisagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictatorAugusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.''Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome inAugust of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba hasexpressed reservations about.``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) isuniversal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering theIbero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had justfinished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday byBritish police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Thejudge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chileunder his rule in the 1970s and 80s.Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader,said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said hethought it placed the government of Chile and President EduardoFrei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending thesummit.Castro said the International Criminal Court ought to beindependent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we already knowwho commands there,'' an obvious reference to the United States.The United States was one of only seven countries that votedagainst creating the court.``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the problem is delicate''and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bearwatching, Castro said.He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet,especially since he had provided support for England during its1982 war with Argentina over the Malvina or Falkland Islands.Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was accusedof providing military intelligence to the British.Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waitedanother 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadowthe summit being held here.``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead ofthe summit,'' he said.Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained as army chiefuntil March when he became a senator-for-life.The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest,insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomaticpassport and had immunity from arrest.(vs/krt)
