	   LONDON (AP) _ Eight years after his turbulent regime ended,
former Chilean strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet is being called to
account by Spanish authorities for the deaths, detention and
torture of political opponents.
	   Responding to a Spanish extradition warrant, British police
announced Saturday they have arrested Pinochet on allegations that
he murdered an unidentified number of Spaniards in Chile between
Sept. 11, 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. No
reason for the dates was given.
	   Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing that
the 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. But
Britain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. Prime
Minister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for the
magistrates and the police.''
	   Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for its
human rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinic
when he was held Friday night.
	   No hearing date has been set.
	   Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his
Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic
when police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochet
underwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorder
which has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.
	   In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where President
Eduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chilean
government said it is ``filing a formal protest with the British
government for what it considers a violation of the diplomatic
immunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''
	   The statement, read by acting foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez, demanded ``that steps be taken to allow an early end of
this situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not recognize
the authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the Ibero
American summit, said his government ``respects the decisions taken
by courts.''
	   British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,
which covers heads of state and government members on official
visits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited as
diplomats.
	   Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,
applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastly
dictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is one
of the great murderers of this century.''
	   Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,
which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the British
government was ``under obligation to take legal action'' against
him.
	   It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,
who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where he
reportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker and
hearing aid, but is generally in good health.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another
judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns
	   Pinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted elected
President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remained
commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, when he was
sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in a
constitution drafted by his regime.
	   While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimes
committed before 1978, when most of his human rights abuses
allegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 political
opponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccounted
for after being detained by his security agents.
