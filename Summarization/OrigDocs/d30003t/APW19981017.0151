	   LONDON (AP) _ An influential lawmaker from the governing Labor
Party on Saturday backed Spanish requests to question former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, in London for back surgery,
on allegations of genocide and terrorism.
	   ''There've been something like a total of 3,197 cases'' of
murder and torture during Pinochet's 1973-90 regime, Ann Clywd said
in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``In the course of a long search by their relatives, the remains
of some of the disappeared have been discovered in unmarked
graves,'' said Ms. Clywd, who chairs an all-party committee of
lawmakers on human rights. ``And hundreds of former detainees have
made statements confirming that the disappeared were held in
detention centers.''
	   ``Clearly, the Spanish authorities have every right to try and
investigate these matters further.''
	   Pinochet, 82, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc a week
ago, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlier
Wednesday. British authorities have declined to comment on his
whereabouts or the Spanish requests.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday. Another judge, Manuel
Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question Pinochet a day
earlier.
	   In 1996, Castellon opened his probe into murder, torture and
disappearances in Chile during Pinochet's regime. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
