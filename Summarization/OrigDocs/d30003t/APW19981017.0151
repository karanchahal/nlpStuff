Augusto Pinochet, in London for back surgery,on allegations of genocide and terrorism.''There've been something like a total of 3,197 cases'' ofmurder and torture during Pinochet's 1973-90 regime, Ann Clywd saidin an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.``In the course of a long search by their relatives, the remainsof some of the disappeared have been discovered in unmarkedgraves,'' said Ms. Clywd, who chairs an all-party committee oflawmakers on human rights. ``And hundreds of former detainees havemade statements confirming that the disappeared were held indetention centers.''``Clearly, the Spanish authorities have every right to try andinvestigate these matters further.''Pinochet, 82, who underwent surgery for a herniated disc a weekago, was reported to have left London Bridge Hospital earlierWednesday. British authorities have declined to comment on hiswhereabouts or the Spanish requests.Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probesinto human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed arequest to question Pinochet on Wednesday.
