WASHINGTON _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet shows thegrowing significance of international human-rights law, suggestingthat officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hidethese days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports, legalscholars say.Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a military dictator from 1973 to1990, was granted amnesty in his homeland but was arrested onFriday in London at the request of Spanish authorities, who wanthim extradited to Spain.A growing body of international law has in the last 10 yearsmade it somewhat easier to reach across borders and apprehendsuspects accused of torture, genocide and other ``crimes againsthumanity.''A lawyer in Washington who represents victims of the Pinochetadministration, Samuel Buffone, said, ``What is really innovativeand important here is that a Spanish court is looking atinternational acts of terrorism, systemic human-rights abuses andgenocide, and is asserting jurisdiction on that basis.''The Spanish authorities contend that Pinochet may have committedcrimes against Spanish citizens in Chile. They said the EuropeanConvention on Terrorism and other treaties required Britain toextradite Pinochet.``The lesson here is that terrorists will have no safe haven andare the modern-day equivalent of pirates,'' Buffone said.``Anywhere they are found on the high seas they will be nabbed andprosecuted.''Thomas Buergenthal, a professor of international law at GeorgeWashington University here, expressed doubts that Pinochet wasentitled to diplomatic immunity, even though he has a diplomaticpassport.``The fact that he wasn't accredited to Britain and was not intransit to a diplomatic post,'' Buergenthal said, ``means thatBritain doesn't have to give him diplomatic immunity, unless therewas some prior arrangement to do so.''The case raises many complex legal questions. For example, doesPinochet have any immunity because of his status as a former headof state or because of his current status as a ``senator for life''in Chile? Chile granted him amnesty, but are other countriesrequired to honor that amnesty? Could Spain try Pinochet for hisactions in Chile?Under the Chilean Constitution, adopted while he was in power,Pinochet is immune from prosecution there.Professor Lori Damrosch, an expert on international law atColumbia University, said: ``That doesn't carry any weight outsideChile. It's not binding on any other country. All theseex-dictators must have an understanding that they are somewhat atrisk when they leave their own countries.''The ``personal inviolability'' of diplomats is a venerableprivilege that can be traced from the protection accorded towartime emissaries in ancient Greece.The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 says,``The purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefitindividuals, but to ensure the efficient performance of thefunctions of diplomatic missions.''Thus, legal scholars say, diplomatic immunity was not created toinsulate people against prosecution for crimes against humanity orother atrocities. In recent years courts have shown an increasedwillingness to try criminal and civil cases involving contentionsthat foreigners committed torture, genocide or war crimes.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Professor Michael Reisman of Yale said: ``In the past a head ofstate would have been given broad immunity for acts committed whilehe was head of state. But international law has moved steadily inthe direction of assigning personal responsibility to suchofficials for grave violations of human rights or the law of war.''Spain's contention that it has the authority to interrogate andtry Pinochet is similar to the United States' argument that it cantry hijackers and terrorists for crimes committed against Americancitizens abroad.Professor Jonathan Charney of the Vanderbilt Law School, editorof The American Journal of International Law, noted that Pinochetis accused of genocide, torture, and cruel and unusual punishment.``These are considered universal crimes,'' he said.
