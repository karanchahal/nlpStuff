   WASHINGTON _ The arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet shows the
growing significance of international human-rights law, suggesting
that officials accused of atrocities have fewer places to hide
these days, even if they are carrying diplomatic passports, legal
scholars say.

   Pinochet, who ruled Chile as a military dictator from 1973 to
1990, was granted amnesty in his homeland but was arrested on
Friday in London at the request of Spanish authorities, who want
him extradited to Spain.
   A growing body of international law has in the last 10 years
made it somewhat easier to reach across borders and apprehend
suspects accused of torture, genocide and other ``crimes against
humanity.''
   A lawyer in Washington who represents victims of the Pinochet
administration, Samuel Buffone, said, ``What is really innovative
and important here is that a Spanish court is looking at
international acts of terrorism, systemic human-rights abuses and
genocide, and is asserting jurisdiction on that basis.''
   The Spanish authorities contend that Pinochet may have committed
crimes against Spanish citizens in Chile. They said the European
Convention on Terrorism and other treaties required Britain to
extradite Pinochet.
   ``The lesson here is that terrorists will have no safe haven and
are the modern-day equivalent of pirates,'' Buffone said.
``Anywhere they are found on the high seas they will be nabbed and
prosecuted.''
   Thomas Buergenthal, a professor of international law at George
Washington University here, expressed doubts that Pinochet was
entitled to diplomatic immunity, even though he has a diplomatic
passport.
   ``The fact that he wasn't accredited to Britain and was not in
transit to a diplomatic post,'' Buergenthal said, ``means that
Britain doesn't have to give him diplomatic immunity, unless there
was some prior arrangement to do so.''
   The case raises many complex legal questions. For example, does
Pinochet have any immunity because of his status as a former head
of state or because of his current status as a ``senator for life''
in Chile? Chile granted him amnesty, but are other countries
required to honor that amnesty? Could Spain try Pinochet for his
actions in Chile?
   Under the Chilean Constitution, adopted while he was in power,
Pinochet is immune from prosecution there.
   Professor Lori Damrosch, an expert on international law at
Columbia University, said: ``That doesn't carry any weight outside
Chile. It's not binding on any other country. All these
ex-dictators must have an understanding that they are somewhat at
risk when they leave their own countries.''
   The ``personal inviolability'' of diplomats is a venerable
privilege that can be traced from the protection accorded to
wartime emissaries in ancient Greece.
   The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 says,
``The purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit
individuals, but to ensure the efficient performance of the
functions of diplomatic missions.''
   Thus, legal scholars say, diplomatic immunity was not created to
insulate people against prosecution for crimes against humanity or
other atrocities. In recent years courts have shown an increased
willingness to try criminal and civil cases involving contentions
that foreigners committed torture, genocide or war crimes.
   Professor Michael Reisman of Yale said: ``In the past a head of
state would have been given broad immunity for acts committed while
he was head of state. But international law has moved steadily in
the direction of assigning personal responsibility to such
officials for grave violations of human rights or the law of war.''
   Spain's contention that it has the authority to interrogate and
try Pinochet is similar to the United States' argument that it can
try hijackers and terrorists for crimes committed against American
citizens abroad.
   Professor Jonathan Charney of the Vanderbilt Law School, editor
of The American Journal of International Law, noted that Pinochet
is accused of genocide, torture, and cruel and unusual punishment.
``These are considered universal crimes,'' he said.
