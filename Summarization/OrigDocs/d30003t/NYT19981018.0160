   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish to
forget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, the immediate popular response here to the
sensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable for
its moderation.
 
 
   About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at the
residence of the British ambassador on Saturday evening to protest
the arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs at the building.
 
 
   Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearby
residence of the Spanish ambassador before the police arrived in a
truck with water cannon, at which point the protesters obediently
withdrew.
 
 
   Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape of
a leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with the
protesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carried
kicking and screaming into a police van.
 
 
   But in a display of uncensored political debate that would have
been unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's rule,
television broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrest
from political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders to
rightist retired generals.
 
 
   Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of Pinochet's
dictatorial ways, including the deaths and disappearances of more
than 3,000 people in the 17 years that followed his violent
overthrow of the elected Socialist government of President Salvador
Allende in 1973.
 
 
   But most political analysts say a large majority wants to put
the era of radical politics and repression behind it, a trend
equally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which also
went through periods of rule by military juntas.
 
 
   President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, in Portugal for a summit
meeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders, charged that Britain
was breaking international law, saying that Pinochet, now an
unelected senator for life, carried a diplomatic passport giving
him legal immunity.
 
 
   Frei leads a governing coalition that includes Christian
Democrats and Socialists, and his strong defense of the general's
rights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilian
politicians who have spent most of their political careers opposing
Pinochet.
 
 
   Only one presidential candidate in next year's elections
expressed support for the Spanish and British actions, and that was
Gladys Marin of the Communist Party. ``I couldn't be more happy,''
she told local television. ``This government has been unwilling to
bring this genocidal criminal to justice over the last eight years,
so it is up to the Spanish to do it.''
 
 
   The leading leftist candidate, Ricardo Lagos of the Socialist
Party, was far more cautious. Lagos gently scolded Pinochet for not
anticipating his arrest abroad but said he did want to get involved
in a judicial matter. Effectively, Lagos was walking a tight line
in order to deflect conservatives' claims that his election would
return Chile to the political and economic turbulence of Allende's
abbreviated rule.
 
 
   The two leading conservative candidates predictably criticized
the arrest, and some rightist politicians urged the government to
break relations with London in protest.
 
 
   Supporters of Pinochet pledged to mobilize street demonstrations
demanding his release, while the Communist Party and human rights
groups promised marches supporting the British action and a
possible Spanish prosecution for alleged crimes against humanity.
 
 
   But Sunday was just another Sunday for most Chileans, who packed
Santiago's parks on a splendidly sunny spring day. A few lightly
armed police officers directed traffic away from the British and
Spanish embassies, and flimsy three-feet high wire fences were
placed around the buildings.
 
 
   Attempting to explain the calm, Mireya Garcia, secretary general
of the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared, said:
``After 25 years of absolute impunity for violators of human
rights, it takes a while for the people to absorb this news and
understand its importance and dimensions.''

   For all the normalcy, the arrest of Pinochet opened a revealing
window into a new Chilean society, one run by democratically
elected civilians side-by-side with a still influential military.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who for years was portrayed as the
devil incarnate in the Chilean media, was shown on television in a
very human light, reacting to the arrest with confused amusement.
 
 
   News clips of Chilean exiles celebrating the arrest received
prominent play. Their shouts of ``murderer'' and posters of the
former dictator bearing the word ``Wanted'' were broadcast on the
same show that included an interview with Augusto Pinochet Hiriart,
Pinochet's son.
 
 
   ``Countries have lost wars and committed real genocide,'' he
said, ``but that is not what happened here.''
