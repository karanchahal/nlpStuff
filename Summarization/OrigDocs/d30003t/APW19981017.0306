	   LONDON (AP) _ British police said Saturday they have arrested
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on allegations of
murdering Spanish citizens during his years in power.
	   Pinochet, 82, in London for surgery, was held Friday night after
British authorities received a Spanish extradition warrant, a
Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
	   The warrant charges that between Sept. 11 1973, the year he
seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983, Pinochet murdered Spanish citizens
in Chile, the spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously.
	   The spokeswoman refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but
Pinochet's press secretary in Santiago said he being held in the
London clinic where he underwent surgery for a herniated disc on
Oct. 9. No hearing date has been set.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, attending the Ibero
American summit in Porto, Portugal, said his government ``respects
the decisions taken by courts.''
	   But Chilean Ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, said he will
seek the release of Pinochet _ ``what we must do is make it clear
that Mr. Pinochet is a senator, who travels with a diplomatic
passport,'' Artaza said. The government has previously said that
Chile does not recognize the authority of foreign courts over
situations which occurred in Chile.
	   Pinochet, who turns 83 next month, was reported to have left
London Bridge Hospital on Wednesday. But his press secretary
Fernando Martinez said he was at the clinic Friday night when
police came for him.
	   Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes
into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a
request to question Pinochet on Wednesday. Another judge, Manuel
Garcia Castellon, filed a request to question Pinochet a day
earlier.
	   Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances in
Chile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is also
investigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in
Argentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
	   Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvement
in ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,
Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaigns
	   The judges' petitions are based on the European Convention on
Terrorism which requires signatories to cooperate with each others'
judicial processes in cases of terrorism, according to Juan Garces,
a lawyer involved in the Spanish investigation into human rights
violations in Chile.
	   Pinochet, who ousted elected President Salvador Allende in a
bloody 1973 coup, remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army
until March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him in a constitution drafted by his regime.
