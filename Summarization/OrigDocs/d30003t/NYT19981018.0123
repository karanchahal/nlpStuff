PARIS _ A stubbornly independent judge who more than once haschallenged the Spanish government, Baltasar Garzon was ridiculedwhen he first set out to pursue the most notorious right-winggenerals in South America for human rights crimes committed in the1970s and '80s, offenses for which they had already been grantedamnesty at home.Now, after Garzon succeeded in getting Scotland Yard to arrestChile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Spanishmagistrate has suddenly moved closer to creating an important legalprecedent, one that could make the retirement of former dictatorsdecidedly uncomfortable.While this is certainly his most spectacular strike, the Madridjudge has long been at the center of controversy. Even beforetaking on the cases against former military rulers in Argentina aswell as Chile, he had earned a high profile in Spain byinvestigating some of the country's most explosive issues, amongthem drug trafficking, Basque terrorism and government corruption.The judge, despite his professorial look, lives a tense life andhas said that he had to grow used to living with death threats. Hemoves around with bodyguards and works under tight security in theoffices of the Madrid special criminal tribunal, known as theNational Court.His critics have often accused him of self-promotion because hetakes on major cases and frequently appears on the front pages ofnewspapers. But Garzon, in a recent interview, responded that he isdetermined to expose crime in high places too easily overlooked andthat in talking to the media he helps to prevent sensitive casesfrom being covered up.His involvement with South America began in 1996 when he openeda criminal investigation after several Spanish legal associationsasked him to look into the torture, disappearance and killing ofSpanish citizens in Argentina during that country's military rulefrom 1976 to 1983.Garzon, who works as an investigating magistrate rather than ajudge on the bench, took more than five months to conclude that aSpanish court could have jurisdiction in the case. He argued that,under Spanish and international law, specifically under the GenevaConventions, serious crimes involving human rights can be triedanywhere and are not subject to any time limit.Garzon felt encouraged not only by support from internationallegal scholars and a U.N. committee, but also by the new efforts ofWestern powers to insure trials and punishment for thoseresponsible for grave human rights violations, including genocide,in Rwanda and the Balkans.Soon, he brought charges against 110 former and active militaryand police officers in Argentina and issued international arrestwarrants against at least 11 senior Argentine military officers,including a former president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. That meantcountries that are part of the Interpol agreement would have toarrest the officers if they traveled outside Argentina.Following the case against Argentina's security forces, anotherjudge serving in the same court as Garzon opened an investigationinto the torture and killing of Spaniards in Chile during the17-year Pinochet dictatorship that ended in 1990. Garzon is nowinvolved in both countries, and the cases have widened to embracenot just the killing of Spaniards but victims of othernationalities.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Since the case against Pinochet began at Madrid's NationalCourt, the United States has agreed to provide the Spanish judgeswith documents related to human rights violations under thePinochet regime. The Madrid court has charged Pinochet and othermembers of the Chilean high command with crimes against humanity,including genocide and terrorism, involving the deaths of more than4,000 people.Both extraterritorial investigations have drawn scorn from thecivilian governments in Argentina and Chile, which have argued thatthe accused military officers have all benefited from amnesties andthat no foreign judge can alter that.Spain's conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has alsotold Buenos Aires and Santiago that he disapproves of theinvestigations, but that he cannot stop them. He and othergovernment officials have complained that the judge's activitiesare complicating their diplomatic relations and risk affectingMadrid's current strategy of expanding its business investments inArgentina and Chile. But the judges have continued to pressforward.On Oct. 14, learning that Pinochet had entered Britain formedical treatment, Garzon asked British judicial authorities tohold the former dictator until Spanish investigators couldinterrogate him about a series of crimes, particularly thosecommitted under a so-called Operation Condor in which Argentina andChile cooperated in torturing and killing several hundred of theirpolitical opponents.British authorities informed Garzon that Pinochet would bereleased from the hospital over the weekend and that they could notlegally detain him. Garzon then issued an arrest warrant againstPinochet, specifically linking him to the case of a Chileancitizen, Edgardo Henriquez, who in April 1976 was kidnapped andtortured in Argentina and soon after handed over to the Chileansecret police, then under Pinochet's command. He has since beenmissing.On Monday, Garzon will reportedly broaden the arrest warrant byadding the names of close to 80 additional victims, who were alsokidnapped in Argentina and handed over to the Chilean secret policeas part of Operation Condor. A lawyer familiar with the proceedingssaid Garzon will also formalize his request that Britain extraditePinochet to Spain.However, before it can be transmitted to British authorities,the extradition request must first be accepted by Spain's Ministryof Justice and then approved by Aznar and his cabinet. Aznar, whois known to favor turning down the request, has given no clearindication yet of the outcome.
