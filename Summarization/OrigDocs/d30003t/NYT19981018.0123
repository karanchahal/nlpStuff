 
   PARIS _ A stubbornly independent judge who more than once has
challenged the Spanish government, Baltasar Garzon was ridiculed
when he first set out to pursue the most notorious right-wing
generals in South America for human rights crimes committed in the
1970s and '80s, offenses for which they had already been granted
amnesty at home.
 
 
   Now, after Garzon succeeded in getting Scotland Yard to arrest
Chile's former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Spanish
magistrate has suddenly moved closer to creating an important legal
precedent, one that could make the retirement of former dictators
decidedly uncomfortable.
 
 
   While this is certainly his most spectacular strike, the Madrid
judge has long been at the center of controversy. Even before
taking on the cases against former military rulers in Argentina as
well as Chile, he had earned a high profile in Spain by
investigating some of the country's most explosive issues, among
them drug trafficking, Basque terrorism and government corruption.
 
 
   The judge, despite his professorial look, lives a tense life and
has said that he had to grow used to living with death threats. He
moves around with bodyguards and works under tight security in the
offices of the Madrid special criminal tribunal, known as the
National Court.
 
 
   His critics have often accused him of self-promotion because he
takes on major cases and frequently appears on the front pages of
newspapers. But Garzon, in a recent interview, responded that he is
determined to expose crime in high places too easily overlooked and
that in talking to the media he helps to prevent sensitive cases
from being covered up.
 
 
   His involvement with South America began in 1996 when he opened
a criminal investigation after several Spanish legal associations
asked him to look into the torture, disappearance and killing of
Spanish citizens in Argentina during that country's military rule
from 1976 to 1983.
 
 
   Garzon, who works as an investigating magistrate rather than a
judge on the bench, took more than five months to conclude that a
Spanish court could have jurisdiction in the case. He argued that,
under Spanish and international law, specifically under the Geneva
Conventions, serious crimes involving human rights can be tried
anywhere and are not subject to any time limit.
 
 
   Garzon felt encouraged not only by support from international
legal scholars and a U.N. committee, but also by the new efforts of
Western powers to insure trials and punishment for those
responsible for grave human rights violations, including genocide,
in Rwanda and the Balkans.
 
 
   Soon, he brought charges against 110 former and active military
and police officers in Argentina and issued international arrest
warrants against at least 11 senior Argentine military officers,
including a former president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. That meant
countries that are part of the Interpol agreement would have to
arrest the officers if they traveled outside Argentina.
 
 
   Following the case against Argentina's security forces, another
judge serving in the same court as Garzon opened an investigation
into the torture and killing of Spaniards in Chile during the
17-year Pinochet dictatorship that ended in 1990. Garzon is now
involved in both countries, and the cases have widened to embrace
not just the killing of Spaniards but victims of other
nationalities.

   Since the case against Pinochet began at Madrid's National
Court, the United States has agreed to provide the Spanish judges
with documents related to human rights violations under the
Pinochet regime. The Madrid court has charged Pinochet and other
members of the Chilean high command with crimes against humanity,
including genocide and terrorism, involving the deaths of more than
4,000 people.
 
 
   Both extraterritorial investigations have drawn scorn from the
civilian governments in Argentina and Chile, which have argued that
the accused military officers have all benefited from amnesties and
that no foreign judge can alter that.
 
 
   Spain's conservative prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, has also
told Buenos Aires and Santiago that he disapproves of the
investigations, but that he cannot stop them. He and other
government officials have complained that the judge's activities
are complicating their diplomatic relations and risk affecting
Madrid's current strategy of expanding its business investments in
Argentina and Chile. But the judges have continued to press
forward.
 
 
   On Oct. 14, learning that Pinochet had entered Britain for
medical treatment, Garzon asked British judicial authorities to
hold the former dictator until Spanish investigators could
interrogate him about a series of crimes, particularly those
committed under a so-called Operation Condor in which Argentina and
Chile cooperated in torturing and killing several hundred of their
political opponents.
 
 
   British authorities informed Garzon that Pinochet would be
released from the hospital over the weekend and that they could not
legally detain him. Garzon then issued an arrest warrant against
Pinochet, specifically linking him to the case of a Chilean
citizen, Edgardo Henriquez, who in April 1976 was kidnapped and
tortured in Argentina and soon after handed over to the Chilean
secret police, then under Pinochet's command. He has since been
missing.
 
 
   On Monday, Garzon will reportedly broaden the arrest warrant by
adding the names of close to 80 additional victims, who were also
kidnapped in Argentina and handed over to the Chilean secret police
as part of Operation Condor. A lawyer familiar with the proceedings
said Garzon will also formalize his request that Britain extradite
Pinochet to Spain.
 
 
   However, before it can be transmitted to British authorities,
the extradition request must first be accepted by Spain's Ministry
of Justice and then approved by Aznar and his cabinet. Aznar, who
is known to favor turning down the request, has given no clear
indication yet of the outcome.
