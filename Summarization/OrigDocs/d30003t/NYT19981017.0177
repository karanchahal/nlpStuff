   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile
as a despot for 17 years, has been arrested in London after Spain
asked that he be extradited for the presumed murders of hundreds of
Chilean and Spanish citizens, the British authorities announced
Saturday.
   The Chilean government immediately demanded his release, arguing
that he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the Chilean
Senate. But so far the British and Spanish authorities have
shrugged off the protests, setting up what promises to be a legal
struggle that could have wide implications for the prosecution of
alleged human rights violators under international law.

   Pinochet, who is 82 and who stepped down as commander in chief
of the Chilean military five months ago, was arrested by the
British police on Friday night, little more than a week after he
arrived in London for surgery on a herniated disc.

   The warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for
``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.'' British
authorities refused to say where Pinochet is being held; nor did
they set a date for when he would be questioned.
 
 
   Ever since he led a violent coup to overthrow Salvador Allende
Gossens, the elected Socialist president in 1973, Pinochet has been
a political icon throughout Latin America, representing the
excesses of a long period of military rule and U.S. support for
right-wing strongmen who opposed Communism.
 
 
   An estimated 3,000 Chileans were shot in the streets or
``disappeared'' during his rule, and a senior member of his regime
was imprisoned under U.S. pressure for the murder of former Foreign
Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.
 
 
   Pinochet cast a long and wide shadow in economic affairs as
well, launching a privatized social security system and other free
market policies that set examples that are still models from
Argentina to Mexico.
   Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, Pinochet was
able to become a senator for life upon his retirement from the
military, a position that afforded him continued political
influence and immunity from prosecution.
   Relatives of disappeared people and political opponents have
filed several lawsuits in Chile seeking to take away his immunity,
but they are given little chance of success.
   To this day, Chileans are deeply divided in their opinion of the
Pinochet legacy, with approximately a third of the country viewing
him as a hero, another third viewing him as a villain and the rest
voicing ambiguous opinions to pollsters.
   A senior Spanish judicial official said Saturday that Judge
Baltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant against
Pinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictator
was about to be released from the hospital and would probably leave
London.
   A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be
identified by name, said the general's arrest was ``a judicial
matter, one for the police and the magistrates.'' But he said ``one
point that does fall to us, he does not have diplomatic immunity in
this country.'' The spokesman declined any further comment.
   An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pinochet
had been arrested ``at the direct, specific request of the Spanish
authorities.''
   Spanish lawyers said the request for Pinochet's extradition had
been sent to Scotland Yard through Interpol. The request was based
on the European Convention on Terrorism, which requires members to
help one another in matters related to terrorism.

   The initial warrant is based on a single case of the kidnapping
and disappearance in 1976 of a Chilean leftist leader, Edgaro
Henriquez, 35.

   
   The Spanish judicial official said that Garzon is planning on
Monday to send to British authorities the names of 78 other people
of various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and taken
to Argentina where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983. He will
also seek the general's extradition to Spain.
   Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various former
Argentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide by
warrants. The focus of his investigation is the so-called Condor
Plan, in which the military juntas of various Latin American
countries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.
   Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Eduardo Menem
of Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing that
they infringe on their nations' sovereignty.
   Amnesty International, the human rights group long critical of
Pinochet, earlier this week urged the British government to assist
the Spanish judges in their prosecution of the former dictator. In
a statement, the group said, ``This would be a clear manifestation
of the British government's commitment to human rights.''
   Human rights and international law experts expressed
enthusiastic support Saturday for the British arrest, and said it
could have wide implications.
   Legal experts noted that since the Nuremberg trials after World
War II, all countries theoretically have been obliged to take
responsibility for crimes against humanity, thereby denying safe
haven to promoters of international crimes like genocide. However,
suspected war criminals, once granted amnesties in their own
countries, have usually been safe from prosecution when they
traveled abroad.
   Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing 4,000 victims of the
Pinochet regime, said the case against the general was based on
international legal principles that there is no immunity for those
responsible for crimes against humanity, even if they served as
heads of state.
   Diane Orentlicher, a law professor and director of the War
Crimes Research Office at American University in Washington, said
the British and Spanish actions put ``teeth into the legal
principle'' that abusers of human rights are international
criminals.
   ``The central point of all of this is that crimes against
humanity transcend the concerns of the countries where the abuses
are committed,'' she said. ``In theory, there should be no safe
haven for world class criminals, but the central problem has been
the enforcement of the law depends on the mobilization of the
world's consciousness.''
   Chile said on Saturday that it would file a formal protest.
``What we must do is make clear that Mr. Pinochet is a senator who
travels with a diplomatic passport,'' said Mario Artaza, Chile's
ambassador to London, in a radio interview Saturday. Artaza added
that Pinochet would not be able testify any time soon because he
was recuperating from painful surgery.
   Chilean officials who served in the Pinochet government have so
far been left virtually untouched for their alleged crimes because
the armed forces still command broad political influence.
   In neighboring Argentina, several military officials served
prison sentences in the 1980s, but they were released under amnesty
laws enacted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
   However, retired Gen. Jorge Videla, who led one of the Argentine
juntas that ruled while Pinochet was in power in Chile, is
currently under house arrest as a judge investigates his alleged
role in kidnapping newborn children of political prisoners so they
might be adopted by military families.
