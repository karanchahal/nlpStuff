BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chileas a despot for 17 years, has been arrested in London after Spainasked that he be extradited for the presumed murders of hundreds ofChilean and Spanish citizens, the British authorities announcedSaturday.The Chilean government immediately demanded his release, arguingthat he has diplomatic immunity since he sits in the ChileanSenate. But so far the British and Spanish authorities haveshrugged off the protests, setting up what promises to be a legalstruggle that could have wide implications for the prosecution ofalleged human rights violators under international law.Pinochet, who is 82 and who stepped down as commander in chiefof the Chilean military five months ago, was arrested by theBritish police on Friday night, little more than a week after hearrived in London for surgery on a herniated disc.The warrant said the general was wanted for questioning for``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.'' Britishauthorities refused to say where Pinochet is being held; nor didthey set a date for when he would be questioned.Ever since he led a violent coup to overthrow Salvador AllendeGossens, the elected Socialist president in 1973, Pinochet has beena political icon throughout Latin America, representing theexcesses of a long period of military rule and U.S. support forright-wing strongmen who opposed Communism.An estimated 3,000 Chileans were shot in the streets or``disappeared'' during his rule, and a senior member of his regimewas imprisoned under U.S. pressure for the murder of former ForeignMinister Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976.Pinochet cast a long and wide shadow in economic affairs aswell, launching a privatized social security system and other freemarket policies that set examples that are still models fromArgentina to Mexico.Under a Constitution that he guided to enactment, Pinochet wasable to become a senator for life upon his retirement from themilitary, a position that afforded him continued politicalinfluence and immunity from prosecution.Relatives of disappeared people and political opponents havefiled several lawsuits in Chile seeking to take away his immunity,but they are given little chance of success.To this day, Chileans are deeply divided in their opinion of thePinochet legacy, with approximately a third of the country viewinghim as a hero, another third viewing him as a villain and the restvoicing ambiguous opinions to pollsters.A senior Spanish judicial official said Saturday that JudgeBaltasar Garzon issued the international arrest warrant againstPinochet on Friday after Interpol warned that the former dictatorwas about to be released from the hospital and would probably leaveLondon.A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to beidentified by name, said the general's arrest was ``a judicialmatter, one for the police and the magistrates.'' But he said ``onepoint that does fall to us, he does not have diplomatic immunity inthis country.'' The spokesman declined any further comment.An official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pinochethad been arrested ``at the direct, specific request of the Spanishauthorities.''Spanish lawyers said the request for Pinochet's extradition hadbeen sent to Scotland Yard through Interpol. The request was basedon the European Convention on Terrorism, which requires members tohelp one another in matters related to terrorism.The initial warrant is based on a single case of the kidnappingand disappearance in 1976 of a Chilean leftist leader, EdgaroHenriquez, 35.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnThe Spanish judicial official said that Garzon is planning onMonday to send to British authorities the names of 78 other peopleof various nationalities who were also kidnapped in Chile and takento Argentina where they disappeared between 1976 and 1983. He willalso seek the general's extradition to Spain.Garzon has also demanded the extradition of various formerArgentina junta rulers, but Argentina has refused to abide bywarrants. The focus of his investigation is the so-called CondorPlan, in which the military juntas of various Latin Americancountries allegedly collaborated to eliminate their enemies.Both President Eduardo Frei of Chile and President Eduardo Menemof Argentina have resisted the Spanish legal motions, arguing thatthey infringe on their nations' sovereignty.Amnesty International, the human rights group long critical ofPinochet, earlier this week urged the British government to assistthe Spanish judges in their prosecution of the former dictator. Ina statement, the group said, ``This would be a clear manifestationof the British government's commitment to human rights.''Human rights and international law experts expressedenthusiastic support Saturday for the British arrest, and said itcould have wide implications.Legal experts noted that since the Nuremberg trials after WorldWar II, all countries theoretically have been obliged to takeresponsibility for crimes against humanity, thereby denying safehaven to promoters of international crimes like genocide. However,suspected war criminals, once granted amnesties in their owncountries, have usually been safe from prosecution when theytraveled abroad.Juan Garces, a Spanish lawyer representing 4,000 victims of thePinochet regime, said the case against the general was based oninternational legal principles that there is no immunity for thoseresponsible for crimes against humanity, even if they served asheads of state.Diane Orentlicher, a law professor and director of the WarCrimes Research Office at American University in Washington, saidthe British and Spanish actions put ``teeth into the legalprinciple'' that abusers of human rights are internationalcriminals.``The central point of all of this is that crimes againsthumanity transcend the concerns of the countries where the abusesare committed,'' she said. ``In theory, there should be no safehaven for world class criminals, but the central problem has beenthe enforcement of the law depends on the mobilization of theworld's consciousness.''Chile said on Saturday that it would file a formal protest.``What we must do is make clear that Mr. Pinochet is a senator whotravels with a diplomatic passport,'' said Mario Artaza, Chile'sambassador to London, in a radio interview Saturday. Artaza addedthat Pinochet would not be able testify any time soon because hewas recuperating from painful surgery.Chilean officials who served in the Pinochet government have sofar been left virtually untouched for their alleged crimes becausethe armed forces still command broad political influence.In neighboring Argentina, several military officials servedprison sentences in the 1980s, but they were released under amnestylaws enacted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.However, retired Gen. Jorge Videla, who led one of the Argentinejuntas that ruled while Pinochet was in power in Chile, iscurrently under house arrest as a judge investigates his allegedrole in kidnapping newborn children of political prisoners so theymight be adopted by military families.
