LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictatorarrested here at the request of a Spanish judge, remainedsequestered under police guard Sunday, awaiting a potentiallydevastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges ofgenocide, terrorism and murder.British officials have not said where Pinochet is, but scores ofChilean emigres gathered Sunday outside the upscale London Clinicwhere the 82-year-old general underwent back surgery Oct. 9. Thedemonstrators jubilantly demanded Pinochet's extradition to Spainand held up photographs of some of the ``disappeared'' among the3,000 people shot or abducted during his 17-year dictatorship, from1973 to 1990.Pinochet's detention late Friday has left Prime Minister TonyBlair's Labor government seemingly embarrassed by the diplomaticimplications of an arrest that has enraged the government of Chile_ which Britain regards as an ally _ and confronted Europeanofficials with uncomfortable implications for their handling ofhuman rights violators from closer to home.``What goes for Gen. Pinochet also goes for all the Mladics andKaradzics who are still in hiding and will be, one day or another,arrested and judged for their crimes,'' said Jacques Poos, theForeign Minister of Luxembourg, referring to the Radovan Karadzicand Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb leaders indicted on war crimescharges by the United Nations War Crime Tribunal in The Hague. Bothhave consistently eluded arrest.Britain, however, seemed uncomfortable about turning thegeneral's detention into any new crusade. Neither Blair nor ForeignSecretary Robin Cook made public statements about the arrest,sheltering behind official statements that it was purely a``judicial matter.''The arrest has reopened a traditional divide between Labor andthe opposition Tories who, while in office until 1997, regularlyallowed Pinochet to enter Britain without fanfare either formedical treatment or to pursue arms deals with British defensecontractors.Blair's government had been under strong pressure from Laborsupporters and human rights groups to display its public commitmentto ethical foreign policies by acting against Pinochet.Word of his presence here produced an outcry in newspapersgenerally supportive of Labor and among Labor legislators. Indeed,Trade Minister Peter Mandelson termed Pinochet a ``brutaldictator'' in a television interview Sunday and said his claim ofdiplomatic immunity against arrest ``for most people in thiscountry would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff.''But Michael Howard, a former Tory Interior Minister who took noaction during Pinochet's earlier visits, said the arrest reflectedthe behavior of ``a very arrogant government'' that may be``displaying its utter contempt for our legal system and for therule of law'' to appease a political constituency.Pinochet was placed under arrest after a senior Spanish judge,Baltasar Garzon, sent a request to detain him in connection withpossible extradition hearings. The warrant on which he was arrestedalleges that Pinochet ``did murder Spanish citizens in Chile withinthe jurisdiction of the government of Spain,'' and was guilty of``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.''Garzon and a Spanish colleague, Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon,are expected to travel to London to question him, possibly in thenext few days.Chile has protested the arrest, insisting that, as a senator forlife, Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity under his diplomaticpassport. But, said Alun Michael, a senior official in the HomeOffice, ``a diplomatic passport does not, of course, guaranteediplomatic immunity.''British officials deny that the detention was politicallyinspired. Michael said Sunday that ``there has been no interventionwhich has been inappropriate at all.''Under British law, the authorities must decide within 40 dayswhether to proceed with extradition. The first step is amagistrates' court hearing where Pinochet's accusers set out theirreasons for extradition. No date for this hearing has been set.Then, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, must decide whether to orderthe extradition.
