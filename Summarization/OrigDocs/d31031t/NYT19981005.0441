WASHINGTON _ With just five days until money for the new fiscalyear runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats onMonday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for notmoving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep thegovernment running.So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills.Congress and the president have adopted a temporary spendingmeasure that expires Friday night at midnight. Republicans in bothhouses said Monday that they expected to complete action on threeor four other bills but would probably have to roll the remaininglegislation into one big catchall package to meet the Fridaydeadline.If they do not meet that deadline, they could extend it,although they would probably do so for only a day or two at a time.If they neither met the deadline nor extended it, parts of thegovernment would shut down.Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic leader,was particularly harsh in his criticism of the majority RepublicansMonday, five days into the 1999 fiscal year.``In my view, this is the worst Congress that has ever sat inthe United States Capitol, that has achieved less than any Congressthat we've ever had,'' Gephardt said at the White House aftermeeting with the president. ``Republicans have wasted the entireyear and have left the heavy lifting until the last week.''Republicans, whom much of the public held responsible forpartial government shutdowns in 1995-96, said Monday that commentslike Gephardt's were proof that congressional Democrats and theadministration were itching for a fight over the spending bills. Infact, they said, they suspect that the Democrats would even welcomea shutdown as a distraction from the drive on Capitol Hill toimpeach the president.The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said onSunday that he was suspicious of the administration.``I am very disturbed by the ability to work with this WhiteHouse,'' Lott said. ``It's a matter of trust, and I'm not sure thatas majority leader now I can trust their actions.''Even when the same party controls the White House and Congress,the lawmakers usually leave the difficult negotiations over thespending bills until the end of each session. But the atmospherethis year is especially charged, with the impeachment process underway just as Congress is trying to wrap up its must-do business.Further complicating matters is that this is an election year,and members are eager not only to leave Washington to campaign butalso to insert their pet projects into the spending bills, althoughthey know that the leaders will decide among themselves what thefinal package contains.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The president has indicated that he could veto at least five ofthe remaining bills. On Monday, in one of his most direct andcomprehensive formulations on the appropriations process, hestepped up pressure on the Republicans to drop their notion of atax cut and to enact his proposals on education, the environmentand disaster relief _ the broad legislative themes that could givehim some political footing in a showdown with Republicans.Clinton addressed several issues that Congress will be hagglingover in the next few days as House and Senate Republicans try toresolve their own differences. He asked Congress to approve fullfinancing for the International Monetary Fund, sought money for100,000 teachers and after-school programs, and said he was alertto what he called ``unacceptable'' anti-environment provisions.``These are the priorities of the American people,'' thepresident said of his proposals, ``and they must be the prioritiesof Congress in these last days before the election.''Some of the spending bills are being held up because of disputesamong Republicans themselves. For example, conservative HouseRepublicans object to Clinton's request for $14 billion to shore upthe reserves of the International Monetary Fund, but many otherRepublicans, in both houses, want to approve it.Gephardt framed the impasse this way: ``Can the Republicanleadership reign in the right wing, the far right wing of theRepublican Party, so we can avoid a shutdown?''Republicans attribute the snags to the president's request formore than $13 billion in emergency spending that they say wouldbreak last year's budget agreement.The four bills that Congress has finished would finance energyand water projects, military construction, defense and theoperations of Congress. In the next couple of days, both houses areexpected to complete action on the agriculture bill, thetransportation bill, the bill financing the veterans and housingdepartments and, possibly, the Treasury and Postal Service bill.Each house will then roll into one big package, or omnibus bill,at least five spending measures that include elements the presidenthas said he will or may veto. He has threatened a veto on theCommerce bill because of a dispute over how the census would beconducted; the Labor bill over Republican resistance to hisproposals for education programs and fuel assistance for low-incomepeople; the Interior bill over several environmental provisions;the District of Columbia bill over school vouchers and aprohibition on homosexual couples' adopting children, and theforeign operations bill over the International Monetary Fund andoverseas family planning.Republican aides said the real negotiations, between the Houseand the Senate and then with the White House, would not start untilWednesday or Thursday, or possibly even Friday.``It will be a massive, days-long conference in a tiny room withno air,'' one top Republican aide said.But this aide, and others, predicted that Congress would try toadjourn in time for members to get home by Monday to campaign inlocal Columbus Day parades.
