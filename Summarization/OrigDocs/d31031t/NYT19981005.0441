 
   WASHINGTON _ With just five days until money for the new fiscal
year runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats on
Monday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for not
moving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government running.
 
 
   So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills.
Congress and the president have adopted a temporary spending
measure that expires Friday night at midnight. Republicans in both
houses said Monday that they expected to complete action on three
or four other bills but would probably have to roll the remaining
legislation into one big catchall package to meet the Friday
deadline.
 
 
   If they do not meet that deadline, they could extend it,
although they would probably do so for only a day or two at a time.
If they neither met the deadline nor extended it, parts of the
government would shut down.
 
 
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic leader,
was particularly harsh in his criticism of the majority Republicans
Monday, five days into the 1999 fiscal year.
 
 
   ``In my view, this is the worst Congress that has ever sat in
the United States Capitol, that has achieved less than any Congress
that we've ever had,'' Gephardt said at the White House after
meeting with the president. ``Republicans have wasted the entire
year and have left the heavy lifting until the last week.''
 
 
   Republicans, whom much of the public held responsible for
partial government shutdowns in 1995-96, said Monday that comments
like Gephardt's were proof that congressional Democrats and the
administration were itching for a fight over the spending bills. In
fact, they said, they suspect that the Democrats would even welcome
a shutdown as a distraction from the drive on Capitol Hill to
impeach the president.
 
 
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said on
Sunday that he was suspicious of the administration.
 
 
   ``I am very disturbed by the ability to work with this White
House,'' Lott said. ``It's a matter of trust, and I'm not sure that
as majority leader now I can trust their actions.''
 
 
   Even when the same party controls the White House and Congress,
the lawmakers usually leave the difficult negotiations over the
spending bills until the end of each session. But the atmosphere
this year is especially charged, with the impeachment process under
way just as Congress is trying to wrap up its must-do business.
 
 
   Further complicating matters is that this is an election year,
and members are eager not only to leave Washington to campaign but
also to insert their pet projects into the spending bills, although
they know that the leaders will decide among themselves what the
final package contains.
 
 
   The president has indicated that he could veto at least five of
the remaining bills. On Monday, in one of his most direct and
comprehensive formulations on the appropriations process, he
stepped up pressure on the Republicans to drop their notion of a
tax cut and to enact his proposals on education, the environment
and disaster relief _ the broad legislative themes that could give
him some political footing in a showdown with Republicans.
 
 
   Clinton addressed several issues that Congress will be haggling
over in the next few days as House and Senate Republicans try to
resolve their own differences. He asked Congress to approve full
financing for the International Monetary Fund, sought money for
100,000 teachers and after-school programs, and said he was alert
to what he called ``unacceptable'' anti-environment provisions.
 
 
   ``These are the priorities of the American people,'' the
president said of his proposals, ``and they must be the priorities
of Congress in these last days before the election.''
 
 
   Some of the spending bills are being held up because of disputes
among Republicans themselves. For example, conservative House
Republicans object to Clinton's request for $14 billion to shore up
the reserves of the International Monetary Fund, but many other
Republicans, in both houses, want to approve it.
 
 
   Gephardt framed the impasse this way: ``Can the Republican
leadership reign in the right wing, the far right wing of the
Republican Party, so we can avoid a shutdown?''
 
 
   Republicans attribute the snags to the president's request for
more than $13 billion in emergency spending that they say would
break last year's budget agreement.
 
 
   The four bills that Congress has finished would finance energy
and water projects, military construction, defense and the
operations of Congress. In the next couple of days, both houses are
expected to complete action on the agriculture bill, the
transportation bill, the bill financing the veterans and housing
departments and, possibly, the Treasury and Postal Service bill.
 
 
   Each house will then roll into one big package, or omnibus bill,
at least five spending measures that include elements the president
has said he will or may veto. He has threatened a veto on the
Commerce bill because of a dispute over how the census would be
conducted; the Labor bill over Republican resistance to his
proposals for education programs and fuel assistance for low-income
people; the Interior bill over several environmental provisions;
the District of Columbia bill over school vouchers and a
prohibition on homosexual couples' adopting children, and the
foreign operations bill over the International Monetary Fund and
overseas family planning.
 
 
   Republican aides said the real negotiations, between the House
and the Senate and then with the White House, would not start until
Wednesday or Thursday, or possibly even Friday.
 
 
   ``It will be a massive, days-long conference in a tiny room with
no air,'' one top Republican aide said.
 
 
   But this aide, and others, predicted that Congress would try to
adjourn in time for members to get home by Monday to campaign in
local Columbus Day parades.
