WASHINGTON _ Republican congressional leaders presented theClinton administration Thursday with a list of lending conditionsthat they want imposed on the International Monetary Fund in orderfor Congress to approve $18 billion in new money for the IMF.Administration and congressional officials said they werehopeful that they could soon agree on compromise legislation toprovide the money to the IMF to refill reserve accounts depleted bythe fund's attempts to bail out the economies of Russia and threeAsian nations.But they said they were still without a timetable for anagreement. Citing the turmoil in international financial markets,the White House has insisted that the legislation be approved andsent to the president before Congress adjourns for the year, whichcould happen this weekend.While the list of conditions being sought by the Republicans wasnot made public, congressional officials said it included a demandthat the IMF open its books for public scrutiny, that it end thepractice of lending to foreign governments at below-market interestrates, and that it shorten the lending period on most loans.The list was presented to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin duringa meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill with the Senate majority leader,Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.After the meeting, Rubin told reporters that it had gone well.``It was a good meeting,'' he said. ``It was very constructive andwe're just going to keep working forward.''Administration officials say the White House is reluctant toaccept any legislation that imposes onerous lending conditions onthe IMF, especially at a time when the fund needs flexibility toavert a global financial meltdown.The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion in new fundfinancing requested by the Clinton administration. But the Househas balked at the request and has so far approved only $3.4billion.The talks this week are aimed at satisfying House Republicanleaders, who are being pressed by conservatives within their partywho have questioned whether the economic crisis that has swept thethird world is evidence that the monetary fund has outlived itsusefulness.``I have been as critical about the IMF as many, but given thecrisis we have around the world, the U.S. needs to provideleadership,'' said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a key Republican inthe talks.He said that given the chaos in international financial markets,the United States was left with no option but to provide the moneyto the fund. ``The only real avenue is the IMF,'' he said.Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a newwillingness to resolve the monetary fund issue _ and to end avariety of other financing disputes with the White House _ in hopesof preventing a government shutdown that might distract publicattention away from the impeachment investigation of PresidentClinton.Moreover, if the United States fails to provide the money othernations might reduce their contributions, leaving the fund short ofthe $90 billion it says is needed to deal with the current worldfinancial crisis.
