WASHINGTON _ With three days until temporary financing of thegovernment expires, Republican leaders met Wednesday night withWhite House officials in their first high-level attempt to resolvedozens of spending issues and avoid a government shutdown.The unresolved issues include financing for the InternationalMonetary Fund, how to conduct the 2000 census, and billions ofdollars in extra spending for items that the administration deemsemergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the year 2000computer bug, and disaster relief for farmers.Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Dick Armey, themajority leader, were hashing out the details behind closed doorsin the speaker's office with Erskine Bowles, President Clinton'schief of staff, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, andLawrence Stein, the administration's liaison with Congress.During a dinner break, Bowles expressed some confidence thatboth sides could reach agreement but said they would be working allnight.``I think we made some reasonable progress, in general,'' hesaid, adding, ``I think we've got a chance.''But he said that no specific issues had been resolved andsuggested none would be until both sides could define the entirescope of what they wanted. ``Nothing is resolved until everythingis resolved,'' he said.At the same time, the Republican leaders were trying to smoothover differences in their own ranks to speed the process along.Over the squawking of both moderates and conservatives, Houseleaders stripped out four controversial provisions from thenettlesome bill that finances the Treasury Department and thePostal Service.The provisions sought to weaken the Federal Election Commission,required the government, to provide health insurance coverage forcontraceptives for female federal workers, to block amnesty for40,000 Haitians living in the United States and to set federalstandards for child care.Last week, so many House members were so upset with theseprovisions that they blocked the bill from being debated on theHouse floor by a vote of 294-106. But Wednesday night, in a vote of231-194 along almost strictly party lines, they approved theprocedures and paved the way toward passage on the floor.(STORY CAN END HERE.

Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who had shepherded the contraceptivemeasure through the House, was upset that Republican leaders simplytossed it out in the final bill even though it had passed the fullHouse twice before and a similar measure had cleared the Senateunanimously by voice vote.``The Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves,'' shesaid. ``They have stomped all over democracy today in their rush tokow-tow to their right wing.''This is a familiar theme among Democrats _ that the Republicanleaders are beholden to their conservative rank and file. But thisis increasingly not the case. As the legislative session hurtlestoward its conclusion, almost nothing from the conservative agendahas advanced beyond symbolic votes on the House floor.Leaders have quite pointedly not held up the spending bills toadvance these causes, spurning conservatives equally with moderatesin the interests of reaching agreements and avoiding a governmentshutdown so that they can keep the spotlight on impeachmentproceedings for Clinton.On the Senate side, Republicans were preparing for final passageof the bill financing Veterans Affairs and the Housing and UrbanAffairs Department. That would bring the number of spending billsCongress has completed action on to six, with seven remaining.Most of those are expected to be wrapped into one big omnibuspackage, perhaps by Saturday, although the negotiations with theWhite House Wednesday evening could change everything.
