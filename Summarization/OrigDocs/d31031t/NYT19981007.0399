 
   WASHINGTON _ With three days until temporary financing of the
government expires, Republican leaders met Wednesday night with
White House officials in their first high-level attempt to resolve
dozens of spending issues and avoid a government shutdown.
 
 
   The unresolved issues include financing for the International
Monetary Fund, how to conduct the 2000 census, and billions of
dollars in extra spending for items that the administration deems
emergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the year 2000
computer bug, and disaster relief for farmers.
 
 
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Dick Armey, the
majority leader, were hashing out the details behind closed doors
in the speaker's office with Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's
chief of staff, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, and
Lawrence Stein, the administration's liaison with Congress.
 
 
   During a dinner break, Bowles expressed some confidence that
both sides could reach agreement but said they would be working all
night.
 
 
   ``I think we made some reasonable progress, in general,'' he
said, adding, ``I think we've got a chance.''
 
 
   But he said that no specific issues had been resolved and
suggested none would be until both sides could define the entire
scope of what they wanted. ``Nothing is resolved until everything
is resolved,'' he said.
 
 
   At the same time, the Republican leaders were trying to smooth
over differences in their own ranks to speed the process along.
Over the squawking of both moderates and conservatives, House
leaders stripped out four controversial provisions from the
nettlesome bill that finances the Treasury Department and the
Postal Service.
 
 
   The provisions sought to weaken the Federal Election Commission,
required the government, to provide health insurance coverage for
contraceptives for female federal workers, to block amnesty for
40,000 Haitians living in the United States and to set federal
standards for child care.
 
 
   Last week, so many House members were so upset with these
provisions that they blocked the bill from being debated on the
House floor by a vote of 294-106. But Wednesday night, in a vote of
231-194 along almost strictly party lines, they approved the
procedures and paved the way toward passage on the floor.
 
 
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who had shepherded the contraceptive
measure through the House, was upset that Republican leaders simply
tossed it out in the final bill even though it had passed the full
House twice before and a similar measure had cleared the Senate
unanimously by voice vote.
 
 
   ``The Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves,'' she
said. ``They have stomped all over democracy today in their rush to
kow-tow to their right wing.''
 
 
   This is a familiar theme among Democrats _ that the Republican
leaders are beholden to their conservative rank and file. But this
is increasingly not the case. As the legislative session hurtles
toward its conclusion, almost nothing from the conservative agenda
has advanced beyond symbolic votes on the House floor.
 
 
   Leaders have quite pointedly not held up the spending bills to
advance these causes, spurning conservatives equally with moderates
in the interests of reaching agreements and avoiding a government
shutdown so that they can keep the spotlight on impeachment
proceedings for Clinton.
 
 
   On the Senate side, Republicans were preparing for final passage
of the bill financing Veterans Affairs and the Housing and Urban
Affairs Department. That would bring the number of spending bills
Congress has completed action on to six, with seven remaining.
 
 
   Most of those are expected to be wrapped into one big omnibus
package, perhaps by Saturday, although the negotiations with the
White House Wednesday evening could change everything.
