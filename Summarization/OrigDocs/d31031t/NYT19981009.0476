WASHINGTON _ With the Republican plan for a big tax cut havingdied without coming to a vote in the Senate, Congress scrambledFriday to put together a far smaller tax package that could winbipartisan support.After giving up hope that the Senate would act on an $80billion, five-year Republican tax cut plan passed last month by theHouse, the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday hurriedlyconsidered and then passed, on a unanimous voice vote, a narrowbill to address some of the tax issues that both parties considermost pressing.The package would extend a series of expiring tax credits,accelerate an existing plan to allow self-employed people to deduct100 percent of their health-insurance premiums and provide a breakto farmers who are hard hit by a downturn in agricultural prices.Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee's chairman, said hehoped that the bill would sail through the House, be adopted by theSenate and be signed into law by President Clinton.The committee's plan, which could be voted on by the full Houseas soon as Saturday, would cost $5.1 billion over five years and$9.2 billion over 10 years. Unlike the original House plan, whichcalled for the $80 billion tax cut to be paid for out of projectedbudget surpluses, the package approved Friday would be paid for byraising other taxes.But Archer's plan quickly hit a roadblock when the SenateFinance Committee decided to draft its own legislation, whichdiffers in several small but important respects from the Houseversion. With Congress racing to deal with a long list of issuesbefore adjourning next week for the midterm elections, themeasure's fate in the Senate remained uncertain.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The end-of-session wrangling over small-bore and largelytechnical tax issues was a long way from what Republicans had hopedfor throughout much of the year.Emboldened by projections that the federal budget surplus wouldrise substantially in the coming years, they debated cutting taxesby hundreds of billions of dollars before scaling back theiraspirations in the face of strong opposition from the president,congressional Democrats and some moderates within their own party.Even the $80 billion five-year plan passed by the House, though,ran afoul of Clinton's demand that Congress set aside any budgetsurpluses until the nation settles on a plan to deal with theSocial Security system's looming financial problems.Senate Republicans, in particular, feared that supporting anytax cut that relied on the budget surplus would lead Democrats toaccuse them of endangering Social Security.Senate Republicans never formally declared the $80 billionpackage dead, with Majority Leader Trent Lott hinting all week thathe might still schedule a vote. But most Republicans haveacknowledged for some time that the bill would never pass theSenate, largely because the parliamentary rules under which thelegislation would be considered would require 60 votes for it tosucceed. Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate.The measure passed by the Ways and Means Committee would extend,to the end of next year, a research and development tax creditstrongly favored by business executives. The Senate FinanceCommittee's version would extend the credit only until the middleof next year, but would also extend a number of other credits notaddressed by the House bill.Both the House and Senate versions would pay for the taxreductions they include largely by closing a loophole used by realestate investment trusts.
