Congress is playing ``chicken'' with the president and theAmerican public. The federal government is now running on borrowedtime. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. There would havebeen a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 1, except thatCongress voted for a ``continuing resolution'' that suppliesemergency funding until Oct. 9.Every year, the president submits his budget requests toCongress in January and February. Congress has until mid-Septemberto consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.But this Congress is playing special-interest politics withappropriations bills. As of Oct. 2, only four of 13 appropriationsbills had been passed. And at least three of the bills yet to bevoted into law have been threatened with a presidential vetobecause of the anti-environmental riders attached to them.Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, butunless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, thepublic can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995_ with the closure of national parks, national monuments, publicbuildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and thefederal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can passanother continuing resolution so that the federal governmentdoesn't shut down on Oct. 10. More borrowed time. More politicalshenanigans.There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congressrealizes it might lose in its collision course with the presidentand the American people. Senate Appropriations Committee ChairmanTed Stevens, R-Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip offsome of the anti-environmental riders he wrote that impact hisstate.House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, echoed Stevens, butpredicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be evenstronger and Republicans will get what they want then. Presumably,the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping andscraping the public lands after this election.But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collisionin this session? A number of powerful special-interest groups haveforked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: thefishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companiesand agricultural interests. Approximately 50 anti-environmentalriders remain attached to various appropriations bills.Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep. BobLivingston, R-La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the InteriorBruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office ofthe Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's publicrelations offices and its congressional relations offices.Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, didn'tlike what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee'santics.Livingston received more than $100,000 in political campaigncontributions from oil and gas, construction and agriculturalindustries in the past two years.And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department ofTransportation appropriations bill contains a provision that wouldallow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas,national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Helicoptersare now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergencypurposes.On Oct. 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickmansent a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of theSubcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee onAppropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill andpromising a recommendation for a veto.Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: ``This provision wouldchange fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlifeprotections and visitor enjoyment in our `last frontier.' Itclearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent forwilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country.''Imagine the ``whopp, whopp, whopp'' of copter blades somewherejust above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautifulsilence of the great wilderness areas. In cold, dense air the soundof helicopter blades carries a long way.The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife _disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds duringwinter when they need to conserve their energy.And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?Extractive industries searching for geological formations thatpromise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters;wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at keylocations; and those intrepid sightseers who want to view theDenali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refugefrom the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to puttheir feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whoppaway. And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exita quick and useful tactic.Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences ofthe wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience _ theOmnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains aprovision to sell off the people's park lands.Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of theInterior to sell, lease, or issue use-permits for parcels of landor structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal NationalHistorical Park.Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with theCumberland Island National Seashore. The bill also would also allowvehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interiorappropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because theydidn't want Sen.Max Baucus, D-Mont., to be successful in adding an amendmentthat would remove a number of anti-environmental riders.Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill inwith several other appropriations measures to create a giganticfunding bill that President Clinton could not veto without seriousrepercussions.And the political games continue.&QL;NYT-10-05-98 1735EDT &QL;
