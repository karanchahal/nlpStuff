WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has begun to consultforeign governments about changes that will be demanded of theInternational Monetary Fund under a deal with Congress to providethe fund with $18 billion, administration and congressionalofficials said Sunday. The administration requested the infusion ofcapital to deal with the global economic crisis.Officials said compromise legislation now being hammered out bythe White House and Republican congressional leaders would providefull financing for the fund, but would also demand greater opennessin its decision-making and new restrictions on its loans.The fund has traditionally made its decisions about loans toforeign governments in secret.The White House has portrayed the $18 billion as vital to theIMF as it seeks to avert an international financial meltdown. Aftera weekend of negotiations, White House officials and members ofCongress said they were optimistic about a deal as part of a largerbudget agreement that is meant to prevent a shutdown of the federalgovernment.``There has been constructive bipartisan discussion,'' said GeneSperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser. ``Allparties are increasingly confident that both full funding andsubstantial reforms will be part of the final agreement.''Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who is involved in the negotiations,said he believed a deal would be announced soon. ``You can see asolution to that on the horizon,'' he said, describing the talks onthe fund as the ``one area'' in the budget talks ``where we'removing much closer to agreement.''The details of the compromise have not been made public, andadministration and congressional officials said at least a handfulof issues remained unresolved, specifically about the type oflending conditions that the United States can try to impose.House Republicans, who had blocked all but $3.4 billion of the$18 billion request, have been seeking a variety of changes in howthe fund is run, including an end to loans at below-market interestrates and a requirement that loans be repaid within a year.Republican leaders say new lending conditions would provide moreincentive to foreign governments to pursue sound economic policies.The administration has warned that some of the demands made bycongressional Republicans would be impossible to force on the IMF,which has 182 members.Administration and congressional officials said theadministration had begun to consult with other nations that are keydonors to head off the possibility that the IMF might balk at newlending conditions.The $18 billion from the United States would replenish accountsdepleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russiaand three Asian nations. Other important donor nations are waitingfor Washington to act before chipping in their shares.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader,said on the ABC News program ``This Week'' that the talks betweenthe White House and Congress were still a ``very rigorousbusiness.''He did not predict when the deal might be reached. ``We'reworking out the details now,'' he said. ``We're working hard on thelanguage and we'll just have to see.''Armey led efforts in the House earlier this year to block fullfinancing for the IMF, and on Sunday he repeated the criticismoften heard on Capitol Hill, from both Republicans and Democrats,that the fund had mishandled the financial crisis that has sweptacross much of the world in recent months.``There seems to be now a growing consensus of understanding,even given lip service by the president himself, that the IMF hasvery likely done more harm in places like Thailand and Russia thanthey've done good,'' he said.``Everybody understands the IMF can have American tax dollars ifthe IMF is responsible and productive in the world economy,'' Armeysaid. ``But we will not continue to give them money to do the kindof harm they've done.
