 
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has begun to consult
foreign governments about changes that will be demanded of the
International Monetary Fund under a deal with Congress to provide
the fund with $18 billion, administration and congressional
officials said Sunday. The administration requested the infusion of
capital to deal with the global economic crisis.
 
 
   Officials said compromise legislation now being hammered out by
the White House and Republican congressional leaders would provide
full financing for the fund, but would also demand greater openness
in its decision-making and new restrictions on its loans.
 
 
   The fund has traditionally made its decisions about loans to
foreign governments in secret.
 
 
   The White House has portrayed the $18 billion as vital to the
IMF as it seeks to avert an international financial meltdown. After
a weekend of negotiations, White House officials and members of
Congress said they were optimistic about a deal as part of a larger
budget agreement that is meant to prevent a shutdown of the federal
government.
 
 
   ``There has been constructive bipartisan discussion,'' said Gene
Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser. ``All
parties are increasingly confident that both full funding and
substantial reforms will be part of the final agreement.''
 
 
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who is involved in the negotiations,
said he believed a deal would be announced soon. ``You can see a
solution to that on the horizon,'' he said, describing the talks on
the fund as the ``one area'' in the budget talks ``where we're
moving much closer to agreement.''
 
 
   The details of the compromise have not been made public, and
administration and congressional officials said at least a handful
of issues remained unresolved, specifically about the type of
lending conditions that the United States can try to impose.
 
 
   House Republicans, who had blocked all but $3.4 billion of the
$18 billion request, have been seeking a variety of changes in how
the fund is run, including an end to loans at below-market interest
rates and a requirement that loans be repaid within a year.
Republican leaders say new lending conditions would provide more
incentive to foreign governments to pursue sound economic policies.
 
 
   The administration has warned that some of the demands made by
congressional Republicans would be impossible to force on the IMF,
which has 182 members.
 
 
   Administration and congressional officials said the
administration had begun to consult with other nations that are key
donors to head off the possibility that the IMF might balk at new
lending conditions.
 
 
   The $18 billion from the United States would replenish accounts
depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia
and three Asian nations. Other important donor nations are waiting
for Washington to act before chipping in their shares.
 
 
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader,
said on the ABC News program ``This Week'' that the talks between
the White House and Congress were still a ``very rigorous
business.''
 
 
   He did not predict when the deal might be reached. ``We're
working out the details now,'' he said. ``We're working hard on the
language and we'll just have to see.''
 
 
   Armey led efforts in the House earlier this year to block full
financing for the IMF, and on Sunday he repeated the criticism
often heard on Capitol Hill, from both Republicans and Democrats,
that the fund had mishandled the financial crisis that has swept
across much of the world in recent months.
 
 
   ``There seems to be now a growing consensus of understanding,
even given lip service by the president himself, that the IMF has
very likely done more harm in places like Thailand and Russia than
they've done good,'' he said.
 
 
   ``Everybody understands the IMF can have American tax dollars if
the IMF is responsible and productive in the world economy,'' Armey
said. ``But we will not continue to give them money to do the kind
of harm they've done. If you've got a fire, you don't subsidize the
arsonist.''
