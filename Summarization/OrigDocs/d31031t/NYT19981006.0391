 
   WASHINGTON _ With four days until temporary financing for the
government runs out, House Republican leaders Tuesday demonstrated
a new willingness to resolve several of the spending issues that
had pointed toward a government shutdown.
 
 
   Republicans want to keep the spotlight on the impeachment
investigation of President Clinton and are therefore eager to brush
away any matters that might interfere. They indicated Tuesday that
they intended to drop their hard-line positions on matters ranging
from less money for the International Monetary Fund to a weakened
Federal Election Commission to a denial of political amnesty for
40,000 Haitians.
 
 
   Many of these signals distressed House conservatives, who said
their leaders were sacrificing their principles to milk all
political advantage from the spectacle of impeaching the president.
But they ceded to their leaders' belief that if they could keep the
focus on impeachment, Republicans would win substantial majorities
in the November elections and then be able to push through their
conservative agenda next year with greater ease.
 
 
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey led the way Tuesday saying he
was dropping his insistence on school vouchers in the District of
Columbia.
 
 
   ``I walked away, for now, from my school-choice bill,'' he told
reporters. ``One of the reasons we are so comfortable with this is
that we know we will be back next year with an even larger majority
in both the House and Senate, and those things that perhaps we
don't get done this year, we can get done next year.''
 
 
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., said his provision to weaken the
Federal Election Commission ``could be dropped.''
 
 
   At the same time, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said he ``could
support a compromise'' on amnesty for the Haitians, which he had
adamantly opposed.
 
 
   The conciliatory moves came as Republican leaders prepared to
meet Wednesday with Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, in
the first high-level negotiating session on the spending bills,
which must be passed by midnight Friday to keep the government
running and performing functions like issuing Social Security
checks and keeping the national parks open.
 
 
   ``There is movement,'' said Livingston, the chairman of the
appropriations committee. ``Tomorrow is a critical day.''
 
 
   With Senate passage Tuesday of the agriculture bill, Congress
has completed work on 5 of the 13 spending measures, with perhaps
two or three more in sight before Friday, when the stopgap bill
expires. Another stopgap measure would be necessary if lawmakers
went beyond the midnight deadline.
 
 
   Armey said he expected Congress to negotiate into the wee hours
Friday and into Saturday but to pass the spending bills in time for
Congress to depart Sunday.

   Members are eager to get home by Monday to campaign in local
Columbus Day celebrations and to avoid the blame they took at the
polls for partial government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996.
 
 
   Senate Republicans sounded somewhat less promising about
wrapping up on time. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told
reporters he was worried that the president wanted to veto some
bills to distract from his woes.
 
 
   ``We're concerned that they are thinking about a domestic `Wag
the Dog,' take advantage of, you know, some way to change the
subject or distract attention from the administration's problems by
not coming to an agreement on this omnibus bill,'' he said. He said
he had not talked to the president since Aug. 20 but that
Wednesday's meeting was important ``to see what they really care
about, if anything.''
 
 
   Lott's skepticism reflects the fact that even as some issues
appear to be falling away, others remain to be resolved between the
House and Senate and then with the White House.
 
 
   One is the census, a seemingly arcane matter but one that both
parties seem ready to go to the mat over. Republicans want the
census to be based on an exact count of every citizen; Democrats
say that would miss millions of people in the inner cities and
rural areas and that the count should be based instead on
statistical sampling. The difference is crucial to both parties
because the census influences federal aid and helps determine the
drawing of congressional boundaries, which in turn influences the
makeup of Congress.
 
 
   Some of the most bitter disputes have been between conservative
Republicans and their moderate counterparts. Conservatives, who
were balking over more than a dozen issues, essentially hoisted the
white flag Tuesday, offering a compromise to agree to keep the
government running but also asking that negotiations continue on
the matters most important to them.
 
 
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of the 40-member
Conservative Action Team in the House, said conservatives were
worried that Republican leaders appeared intimidated by the
president's veto threats.
 
 
   ``We are saying to the leadership that if they give up
everything to the president and the liberals, we're not sure
they're the right people to be leading us,'' McIntosh said.
 
 
 
   The conservatives are most concerned about breaking the spending
caps set in last year's balanced-budget agreement. They say that
Clinton's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending,
for matters like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the
year 2000 computer bug, are not true unforeseen emergencies and
should have been included in the president's budget request. They
want both Congress and the president to make cuts elsewhere in the
budget to make up for these nonemergencies.
 
 
   Conservatives are also convinced that spending $18 billion on
the International Monetary Fund is a waste of money, but Democrats
are adamant that the money be provided.
 
 
   ``We aren't going to leave here without it,'' said Rep. David
Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the appropriations
committee.
 
 
   House and Senate leaders said they expected five spending bills
to be especially difficult to negotiate and that they would
probably be wrapped into one big omnibus package at the end of the
week and sent to the White House.
 
 
   The bills most likely to end up in that package, all of which
have drawn veto threats from the administration, have not yet been
agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators. Those bills would
finance the following departments and areas:
 
 
   _ Commerce, State and Justice Departments. This bill includes
the census, perhaps the most contentious issue between the parties.
 
 
   _ Foreign Operations. This bill contains financing for the
International Monetary Fund and would restrict United States aid
for overseas family planning groups advocating abortion.
 
 
   _ Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service. The four
contentious provisions attached to this bill would block amnesty
for the 40,000 Haitians, require federal health plans to pay for
contraceptives for women who are federal employees, impose federal
standards for day care on state and local governments, and weaken
the Federal Election Commission by limiting the term of the general
counsel and staff director to four years, unless four of six
commissioners approved a re-appointment. Democrats said that
measure was aimed at removing the current general counsel.
 
 
   Republicans, deeply divided over these issues, prevented the
House from debating this bill last week, and a conference Tuesday
failed to resolve anything, although various Republicans said later
that they could compromise on some provisions. Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., said the bill would have the best chance of passing if it
were stripped of everything except the measure for contraceptives.
 
 
   _ Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments.
This bill contains millions of dollars sought by the administration
for education programs, including 100,000 teachers and expanded
after-school and summer-school programs. It would also pay for fuel
assistance for low-income families and job-training programs.
 
 
   _ Interior Department. Republicans have attached provisions that
the president deems to be anti-environment.
