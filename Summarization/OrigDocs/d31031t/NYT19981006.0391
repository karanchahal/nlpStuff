WASHINGTON _ With four days until temporary financing for thegovernment runs out, House Republican leaders Tuesday demonstrateda new willingness to resolve several of the spending issues thathad pointed toward a government shutdown.Republicans want to keep the spotlight on the impeachmentinvestigation of President Clinton and are therefore eager to brushaway any matters that might interfere. They indicated Tuesday thatthey intended to drop their hard-line positions on matters rangingfrom less money for the International Monetary Fund to a weakenedFederal Election Commission to a denial of political amnesty for40,000 Haitians.Many of these signals distressed House conservatives, who saidtheir leaders were sacrificing their principles to milk allpolitical advantage from the spectacle of impeaching the president.But they ceded to their leaders' belief that if they could keep thefocus on impeachment, Republicans would win substantial majoritiesin the November elections and then be able to push through theirconservative agenda next year with greater ease.House Majority Leader Dick Armey led the way Tuesday saying hewas dropping his insistence on school vouchers in the District ofColumbia.``I walked away, for now, from my school-choice bill,'' he toldreporters. ``One of the reasons we are so comfortable with this isthat we know we will be back next year with an even larger majorityin both the House and Senate, and those things that perhaps wedon't get done this year, we can get done next year.''Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., said his provision to weaken theFederal Election Commission ``could be dropped.''At the same time, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said he ``couldsupport a compromise'' on amnesty for the Haitians, which he hadadamantly opposed.The conciliatory moves came as Republican leaders prepared tomeet Wednesday with Clinton's chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, inthe first high-level negotiating session on the spending bills,which must be passed by midnight Friday to keep the governmentrunning and performing functions like issuing Social Securitychecks and keeping the national parks open.``There is movement,'' said Livingston, the chairman of theappropriations committee. ``Tomorrow is a critical day.''With Senate passage Tuesday of the agriculture bill, Congresshas completed work on 5 of the 13 spending measures, with perhapstwo or three more in sight before Friday, when the stopgap billexpires. Another stopgap measure would be necessary if lawmakerswent beyond the midnight deadline.Armey said he expected Congress to negotiate into the wee hoursFriday and into Saturday but to pass the spending bills in time forCongress to depart Sunday.(STORY CAN END HERE.

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott toldreporters he was worried that the president wanted to veto somebills to distract from his woes.``We're concerned that they are thinking about a domestic `Wagthe Dog,' take advantage of, you know, some way to change thesubject or distract attention from the administration's problems bynot coming to an agreement on this omnibus bill,'' he said. He saidhe had not talked to the president since Aug. 20 but thatWednesday's meeting was important ``to see what they really careabout, if anything.''Lott's skepticism reflects the fact that even as some issuesappear to be falling away, others remain to be resolved between theHouse and Senate and then with the White House.One is the census, a seemingly arcane matter but one that bothparties seem ready to go to the mat over. Republicans want thecensus to be based on an exact count of every citizen; Democratssay that would miss millions of people in the inner cities andrural areas and that the count should be based instead onstatistical sampling. The difference is crucial to both partiesbecause the census influences federal aid and helps determine thedrawing of congressional boundaries, which in turn influences themakeup of Congress.Some of the most bitter disputes have been between conservativeRepublicans and their moderate counterparts. Conservatives, whowere balking over more than a dozen issues, essentially hoisted thewhite flag Tuesday, offering a compromise to agree to keep thegovernment running but also asking that negotiations continue onthe matters most important to them.Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., a leader of the 40-memberConservative Action Team in the House, said conservatives wereworried that Republican leaders appeared intimidated by thepresident's veto threats.``We are saying to the leadership that if they give upeverything to the president and the liberals, we're not surethey're the right people to be leading us,'' McIntosh said.(STORY CAN END HERE.

They say thatClinton's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending,for matters like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing theyear 2000 computer bug, are not true unforeseen emergencies andshould have been included in the president's budget request. Theywant both Congress and the president to make cuts elsewhere in thebudget to make up for these nonemergencies.Conservatives are also convinced that spending $18 billion onthe International Monetary Fund is a waste of money, but Democratsare adamant that the money be provided.``We aren't going to leave here without it,'' said Rep. DavidObey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the appropriationscommittee.House and Senate leaders said they expected five spending billsto be especially difficult to negotiate and that they wouldprobably be wrapped into one big omnibus package at the end of theweek and sent to the White House.The bills most likely to end up in that package, all of whichhave drawn veto threats from the administration, have not yet beenagreed upon by House and Senate negotiators. Those bills wouldfinance the following departments and areas:_ Commerce, State and Justice Departments. This bill includesthe census, perhaps the most contentious issue between the parties._ Foreign Operations. This bill contains financing for theInternational Monetary Fund and would restrict United States aidfor overseas family planning groups advocating abortion._ Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service. The fourcontentious provisions attached to this bill would block amnestyfor the 40,000 Haitians, require federal health plans to pay forcontraceptives for women who are federal employees, impose federalstandards for day care on state and local governments, and weakenthe Federal Election Commission by limiting the term of the generalcounsel and staff director to four years, unless four of sixcommissioners approved a re-appointment. Democrats said thatmeasure was aimed at removing the current general counsel.Republicans, deeply divided over these issues, prevented theHouse from debating this bill last week, and a conference Tuesdayfailed to resolve anything, although various Republicans said laterthat they could compromise on some provisions. Rep. Jim Kolbe,R-Ariz., said the bill would have the best chance of passing if itwere stripped of everything except the measure for contraceptives._ Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments.This bill contains millions of dollars sought by the administrationfor education programs, including 100,000 teachers and expandedafter-school and summer-school programs. It would also pay for fuelassistance for low-income families and job-training programs._ Interior Department. Republicans have attached provisions thatthe president deems to be anti-environment.
