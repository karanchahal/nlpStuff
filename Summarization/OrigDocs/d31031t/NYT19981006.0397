The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:In an atmosphere already bitter over impeachment proceedings,President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders are headingtoward another nasty confrontation on the budget that threatens toshut down the government.In this dispute, however, the White House has a strong hand.Despite his political problems, Clinton is right to insist onlegislation free of objectionable attachments to keep governmentoperations going past Friday. The most offensive riders underconsideration would damage natural resources, cut programs forschools and the poor and impose mischievous new curbs on abortionand contraception.The reason for the latest battle is that Republicans in Congresshave been mired in their own budget disputes all year, withhard-line conservatives favoring domestic spending cuts, moderatesloath to provoke a veto by Clinton and their leaders reluctant tohand him a fight that draws attention from his sex scandal.In a sign of Clinton's continued leverage, the Republicans cavedin Tuesday on the ill-advised $80 billion tax cut approved lastmonth in the House, which was to have been paid for out of thisyear's budget surplus. The question now is whether they will cometo their senses on other destructive measures.At a time of grave financial crisis around the world, forinstance, it would be foolish to reject full funding for theInternational Monetary Fund, which the Senate has already approved.House Republicans should also back down on cuts in educationprograms, fuel assistance for low-income people and gratuitousgestures like the attempts to weaken the Federal ElectionCommission or limit contraceptive coverage in federal employeehealth benefits.As they have done in the past, Western Republicans in the Senatehave added more than 20 last-minute riders to the InteriorDepartment spending bill that would weaken protections forfisheries, wilderness areas and national forests. House Republicanshave badly shortchanged the Everglades restoration program. Canlawmakers be so out of touch that they would try to capitalize onthe president's political difficulties for a backdoor attack on theenvironment?One of the more absurd contentions by Republicans is that theyneed to cut programs to make funds available for such emergenciesas assistance to farmers, the troops in Bosnia and the crashprogram to update the government's computers for the year 2000. ButCongress has long recognized that emergencies may be met withoutcuts in spending elsewhere.In the spending and environmental areas, at least, Clinton hasset out the right priorities. He should stick to them even if itmeans vetoing unacceptable legislation and provoking a fight thatlawmakers do not want.
