 
   WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations faltered Friday, prompting
Congress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing a
spending bill to keep the government open.
 
 
   Republican leaders vowed they would not let the government shut
down. At the same time, many rank-and-file members of Congress,
suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home to
campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarily
Friday night in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in the
hands of Republican leaders and the White House. They are subject
to return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package,
probably not before Monday.
 
 
   Meanwhile the chairmen of the spending committees and Republican
leaders engaged in on-and-off negotiations with the White House.
The two sides met twice Friday and were working Friday night, but
little overt progress was made on the spending bills as the process
devolved into a political blame game, with each side trying to
control the message that goes out to voters.
 
 
   President Clinton said that Republicans were not providing
enough money for his education initiatives, including measures to
hire teachers and repair schools.
 
 
   ``This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine
months of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing about
our children's future,'' the president said.
 
 
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, responded that he was astounded to see the president on
television complaining about Republicans when the White House had
failed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for the
billions of dollars that the president was seeking for his own
proposals.
 
 
   Republicans were keenly aware that the president had
successfully blamed them for previous government shutdowns, in 1995
and 1996, and were determined Friday not to let that happen again.
 
 
   As the negotiations stalled, Livingston asserted, ``There's not
going to be a shutdown.''
 
 
   The Republicans were responding not only to the president but to
a prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were giving
in to the administration's demands behind the scenes in order to
make a quick break from Washington and leave with the political
focus on the impending impeachment inquiry.
 
 
   Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and were
advancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalize
on the president's woes in their re-election campaigns, were being
careless about the budget.
 
 
   ``They're cutting out on everything because they want to get out
of here,'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass. ``The impeachment stuff
has been draining on the whole institution. It's been sucking all
the air out.''
 
 
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., emerged from a closed-door meeting
of her colleagues saying she was ``disappointed that the president
has put us on the defense.''
 
 
   But really, said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a member of the
Republican leadership, Republicans ``want to stay here and work,
work, work.''
 
 
   A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
put the message in plain English: ``We're not going to give them
the ability to say it's our fault.''
 
 
   But that is precisely the message that Clinton and Democratic
leaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blocking
bills concerning health care, campaign finance and the minimum
wage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13
must-pass spending bills that keep the government going.
 
 
   Only two of those bills have been signed into law. Four others
have been sent to the president, and he has vetoed one. The current
negotiations are over several contentious items in the remaining
seven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibus
bill and presented to the president next week.
 
 
   The Senate added to that bloated omnibus Friday by killing the
bill financing the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
 
 
   Friday's deadline extension is the second that Congress has
sought in two weeks. The first took Congress through Friday night,
even though the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.
 
 
   In other action Friday, the House approved, 300-125, legislation
overhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still faced
the threat of a veto from the White House and opposition from
Senate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit card
lending and marketing practices. Friday night, however, Democrats
withdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.
 
 
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. said the Democrats had relented
after Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would not
pass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in the
omnibus spending measure needed to end the congressional session.
