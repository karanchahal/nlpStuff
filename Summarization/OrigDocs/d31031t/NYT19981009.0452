WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations faltered Friday, promptingCongress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing aspending bill to keep the government open.Republican leaders vowed they would not let the government shutdown. At the same time, many rank-and-file members of Congress,suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home tocampaign for the Nov. 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarilyFriday night in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in thehands of Republican leaders and the White House. They are subjectto return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package,probably not before Monday.Meanwhile the chairmen of the spending committees and Republicanleaders engaged in on-and-off negotiations with the White House.The two sides met twice Friday and were working Friday night, butlittle overt progress was made on the spending bills as the processdevolved into a political blame game, with each side trying tocontrol the message that goes out to voters.President Clinton said that Republicans were not providingenough money for his education initiatives, including measures tohire teachers and repair schools.``This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after ninemonths of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing aboutour children's future,'' the president said.Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the AppropriationsCommittee, responded that he was astounded to see the president ontelevision complaining about Republicans when the White House hadfailed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for thebillions of dollars that the president was seeking for his ownproposals.Republicans were keenly aware that the president hadsuccessfully blamed them for previous government shutdowns, in 1995and 1996, and were determined Friday not to let that happen again.As the negotiations stalled, Livingston asserted, ``There's notgoing to be a shutdown.''The Republicans were responding not only to the president but toa prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were givingin to the administration's demands behind the scenes in order tomake a quick break from Washington and leave with the politicalfocus on the impending impeachment inquiry.Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and wereadvancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalizeon the president's woes in their re-election campaigns, were beingcareless about the budget.``They're cutting out on everything because they want to get outof here,'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass. ``The impeachment stuffhas been draining on the whole institution. It's been sucking allthe air out.''Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., emerged from a closed-door meetingof her colleagues saying she was ``disappointed that the presidenthas put us on the defense.''But really, said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a member of theRepublican leadership, Republicans ``want to stay here and work,work, work.''A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymityput the message in plain English: ``We're not going to give themthe ability to say it's our fault.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)But that is precisely the message that Clinton and Democraticleaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blockingbills concerning health care, campaign finance and the minimumwage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13must-pass spending bills that keep the government going.Only two of those bills have been signed into law. Four othershave been sent to the president, and he has vetoed one. The currentnegotiations are over several contentious items in the remainingseven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibusbill and presented to the president next week.The Senate added to that bloated omnibus Friday by killing thebill financing the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.Friday's deadline extension is the second that Congress hassought in two weeks. The first took Congress through Friday night,even though the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.In other action Friday, the House approved, 300-125, legislationoverhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still facedthe threat of a veto from the White House and opposition fromSenate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit cardlending and marketing practices. Friday night, however, Democratswithdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. said the Democrats had relentedafter Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would notpass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in theomnibus spending measure needed to end the congressional session.
