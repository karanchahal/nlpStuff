ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A three-week-old crisis between Turkey andSyria appears to have been at least temporarily defused by thesigning of an agreement in which Syria agreed to stop supportingKurdish rebels, who are demanding a homeland in Turkey.Turkey had demanded that Syria cease all support for theguerrilla force known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, whichis fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey. It alsodemanded that Syria expel the guerrillas' leader, Abdullah Ocalan.According to a text made public by Turkish officials, theagreement stipulates that Syria ``will not allow the PKK to receivemilitary, logistic or financial support or to carry out propagandaon its soil.''Ocalan's current whereabouts are unclear. He asserted in atelephone interview with journalists last week that he is ``inKurdistan,'' which could mean either southeastern Turkey ornorthern Iraq. Other reports place him in Russia, Cyprus, Iran orArmenia. Some say he remains in Damascus.``He has been in a Moscow suburb for a week,'' Prime MinisterMesut Yilmaz of Turkey said on Tuesday. ``We have taken seriousinitiatives for his extradition.''The Russian ambassador in Turkey, Alexander Lebedev, denied thatOcalan was in Russia.Turkey set off the crisis this month by threatening to takemilitary action against Syria if it did not stop supporting Kurdishrebels. Officials from the two countries met on Monday and Tuesdayin southeastern Turkey.The agreement has not yet been officially announced in Syria,but Turkish officials said that it had been signed by a seniorSyrian officer, Gen. Adnan Badr al-Hassan, and that they assumed itrepresented Syria's official position.``This document should be considered as an agreement which endsthe crisis and starts dialogue,'' said Necati Uktan, a spokesmanfor the Turkish Foreign Ministry.``Syria extends its hand of friendship to us,'' Uktan said. ``Ifeverything is realized on the framework of the agreement, we willthen shake this hand. If we consider the worst scenario and thinkthat this will not be realized, our military measures will beenforced at this stage.''(STORY CAN END HERE.

They said theywould not discuss Syria's grievances against Turkey, which includewater issues and the status of Hatay Province, which is part ofTurkey but claimed by Syria. On Tuesday a Syrian television stationbroadcast a commentary asserting that Hatay ``is an integral partof Syria and cannot be surrendered.''Foreign diplomats in Turkey who monitor developments in theMiddle East said they would reserve judgment on the accordannounced Wednesday.``The Syrians have always said that they don't support the PKKand that Ocalan is not there,'' a diplomat said. ``So what they'vepromised doesn't really change much officially.''``The proof is in the pudding,'' said the diplomat, who spoke onthe condition of anonymity. ``Let's see how the Turks manage topull off verification. I don't expect them to go in bombing, butthey're going to have to find a way to see if anything reallychanges in Syria.''Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said his government would``carefully follow whether Syria is keeping and implementing thesepromises.''
