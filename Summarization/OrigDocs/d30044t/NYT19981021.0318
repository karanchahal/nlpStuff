 
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A three-week-old crisis between Turkey and
Syria appears to have been at least temporarily defused by the
signing of an agreement in which Syria agreed to stop supporting
Kurdish rebels, who are demanding a homeland in Turkey.
 
 
   Turkey had demanded that Syria cease all support for the
guerrilla force known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which
is fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey. It also
demanded that Syria expel the guerrillas' leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
 
 
   According to a text made public by Turkish officials, the
agreement stipulates that Syria ``will not allow the PKK to receive
military, logistic or financial support or to carry out propaganda
on its soil.''
 
 
   Ocalan's current whereabouts are unclear. He asserted in a
telephone interview with journalists last week that he is ``in
Kurdistan,'' which could mean either southeastern Turkey or
northern Iraq. Other reports place him in Russia, Cyprus, Iran or
Armenia. Some say he remains in Damascus.
 
 
   ``He has been in a Moscow suburb for a week,'' Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said on Tuesday. ``We have taken serious
initiatives for his extradition.''
 
 
   The Russian ambassador in Turkey, Alexander Lebedev, denied that
Ocalan was in Russia.
 
 
   Turkey set off the crisis this month by threatening to take
military action against Syria if it did not stop supporting Kurdish
rebels. Officials from the two countries met on Monday and Tuesday
in southeastern Turkey.
 
 
   The agreement has not yet been officially announced in Syria,
but Turkish officials said that it had been signed by a senior
Syrian officer, Gen. Adnan Badr al-Hassan, and that they assumed it
represented Syria's official position.
 
 
   ``This document should be considered as an agreement which ends
the crisis and starts dialogue,'' said Necati Uktan, a spokesman
for the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
 
 
   ``Syria extends its hand of friendship to us,'' Uktan said. ``If
everything is realized on the framework of the agreement, we will
then shake this hand. If we consider the worst scenario and think
that this will not be realized, our military measures will be
enforced at this stage.''
 
 
   The two countries were brought together in part through the
efforts of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
 
 
   ``We are pleased that we helped defuse the crisis between the
two countries,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in Cairo
Wednesday. ``All we care about is that both sides reach a
settlement, which could certainly spare the region lots of
tension.''
 
 
   Turkish officials had insisted that talks with Syria cover only
the question of support for Kurdish insurgents. They said they
would not discuss Syria's grievances against Turkey, which include
water issues and the status of Hatay Province, which is part of
Turkey but claimed by Syria. On Tuesday a Syrian television station
broadcast a commentary asserting that Hatay ``is an integral part
of Syria and cannot be surrendered.''
 
 
   Foreign diplomats in Turkey who monitor developments in the
Middle East said they would reserve judgment on the accord
announced Wednesday.
 
 
   ``The Syrians have always said that they don't support the PKK
and that Ocalan is not there,'' a diplomat said. ``So what they've
promised doesn't really change much officially.''
 
 
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Let's see how the Turks manage to
pull off verification. I don't expect them to go in bombing, but
they're going to have to find a way to see if anything really
changes in Syria.''
 
 
   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said his government would
``carefully follow whether Syria is keeping and implementing these
promises.''
