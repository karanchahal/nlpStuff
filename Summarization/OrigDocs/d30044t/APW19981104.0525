MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked PresidentBoris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leaderAbdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading aterrorist organization.Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has beenfighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The conflicthas killed an estimated 37,000 people.Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seekingasylum after Ocalan wrote the State Duma, parliament's lower house,thanking it for supporting his cause. Ocalan had officiallyrequested asylum, Interfax reported.``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' Nikiforenkosaid.The Duma supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkishgovernment's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded thatTurkey withdraw its troops.In his letter to the Duma, Ocalan accused the Turkish governmentof trying ``to annihilate the leadership of the Kurdish WorkersParty, drown in blood the national liberation struggle by theKurdish people and thus pave the way for their control of theentire Middle East.''Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the Dumavote, and said he hoped President Boris Yeltsin would `take on arealistic and constructive approach.''``Instead of forging ties with a terrorist organization like thePKK, (Russia) should keep good relations with a country likeTurkey,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital.Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently leftSyria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirmthat he is in the country.Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere inthe Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iranand Syria.(vi/gm/ml)
