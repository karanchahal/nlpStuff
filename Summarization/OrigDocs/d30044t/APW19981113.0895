ROME (AP) _ The leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency,considered a terrorist by Turkey and its most-wanted criminal, hasbeen arrested in Rome, setting up a major battle with Italy overhis extradition.Abdullah Ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane fromMoscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing hishideout in Syria, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, whichhas been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursdaynight at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome because of anoutstanding Turkish warrant.``Once identified, the Italian government had the obligation togo ahead with his arrest given the serious charges against him,''said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading aterrorist organization, threatening the country's territorialintegrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the deathpenalty.Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 thataccuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and beingthe head of a terrorist organization.Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984,Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there waseven a risk of capital punishment.Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flewto Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. Furtherchecks revealed his identity, Cosson said.Ocalan was held in a Rome prison, pending a hearing on Turkey'srequest for extradition. No hearing date was immediately set.Earlier reports said he was being treated in a hospital aftercomplaining of feeling unwell.In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who has been on thepolitical ropes in a corruption scandal, hailed the arrest asevidence the government's crackdown on the rebels was succeeding.``As a result of the pressure we have applied on Syria, ourstruggle against terrorism has reached a very positive stage,''Yilmaz said. He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankarafor Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made thesame request.``As our NATO ally we do not believe that Italy would make thewrong decision,'' Yilmaz said.It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is notknown to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, theso-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited byItalian deputies to hold a session in the capital.A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum inItaly, a call also taken up by leftist politicians in the Italianparliament, who asked their government to grant it.Ocalan was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascusfollowing Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria haslong supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, apolitical science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalanturned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertileground among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK withinTurkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq andthe fighting continues.(ht-sf-fd)
