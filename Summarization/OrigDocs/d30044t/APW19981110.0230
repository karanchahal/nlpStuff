YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Seven female members of a Kurdish groupwere on a three-day hunger strike Tuesday in support of acontroversial Kurdish leader, whom they claim is being persecuted.The women, who began their protest Monday at the Freedom for theWomen of Kurdistan building in the Armenian capital, were dancing,singing and watching Kurdish television on Tuesday.The walls in the room were adorned with portraits of AbdullahOcalan, who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. Thegroup has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.``Fighting against imperialism, fascism and the colonial policyof Turkey, we are approaching the victory in the cause ofliberation of our people,'' the women said in a statement.Kurds elsewhere were also demonstrating in support of Ocalan,said the PKK leader in Armenia Mraz Khumoyan. Ocalan has beenlabeled a terrorist by Turkey and the United States.Turkish leaders say Ocalan is currently hiding in Russia, butRussian officials have refused to confirm that he is in thecountry.Last week, Russia's parliament passed an appeal asking PresidentBoris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Ocalan. Officials sayYeltsin is unlikely to heed parliament's appeal.(str/nw/gm)
