	   ROME (AP) _ Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Kurdish insurgents who
has been sought for years by Turkey, has been detained in Rome
after stepping off a plane from Moscow, Turkish and Italian
officials said Friday.
	   Necati Bilican, Turkey's police chief, said his country would do
whatever necessary to extradite the rebel leader.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict. Turkey considers
the group a terrorist organization.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday
night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.
	   Ocalan is wanted under an international arrest warrant,
according to Turkish authorities.
	   He is on trial in Turkey in absentia on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death
penalty.
	   Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that
accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being
the head of a terrorist organization.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said its envoy in Rome was making
an immediate extradition request, but it could run into
difficulties. Although there have been no executions in Turkey
since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if
there was even a risk of capital punishment.
	   Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew
to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. They then
made further checks and discovered his identity, Cosson said.
	   Claiming he was not feeling well, Ocalan asked to be taken to a
hospital, the Italian official said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in
Italy.
	   Ocalan, was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   According to Turkish officials, Ocalan had fled to Russia and
sought political asylum from Moscow.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.
