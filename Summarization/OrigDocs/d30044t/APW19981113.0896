	   ROME (AP) _ The leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency,
considered a terrorist by Turkey and its most-wanted criminal, has
been arrested in Rome, setting up a major battle with Italy over
his extradition.
	   Abdullah Ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday
night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome because of an
outstanding Turkish warrant.
	   ``Once identified, the Italian government had the obligation to
go ahead with his arrest given the serious charges against him,''
said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death
penalty.
	   Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that
accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being
the head of a terrorist organization.
	   Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984,
Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there was
even a risk of capital punishment.
	   Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew
to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. Further
checks revealed his identity, Cosson said.
	   Ocalan was held in a Rome prison, pending a hearing on Turkey's
request for extradition. No hearing date was immediately set.
Earlier reports said he was being treated in a hospital after
complaining of feeling unwell.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who has been on the
political ropes in a corruption scandal, hailed the arrest as
evidence the government's crackdown on the rebels was succeeding.
	   ``As a result of the pressure we have applied on Syria, our
struggle against terrorism has reached a very positive stage,''
Yilmaz said. He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara
for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the
same request.
	   ``As our NATO ally we do not believe that Italy would make the
wrong decision,'' Yilmaz said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in
Italy, a call also taken up by leftist politicians in the Italian
parliament, who asked their government to grant it.
	   Ocalan was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile
ground among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.
