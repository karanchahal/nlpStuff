GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitatedheads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote villageafter a two-month search in the breakaway region in southernRussia.An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near thevillage of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west ofGrozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.The heads were identified as those of the four abductedforeigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned tothe four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen inGrozny. He said the bodies had not been found.But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodieshad been found without giving further details. Chechen PresidentAslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had beenrecovered.The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and RudolfPetschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were engineers. They wereworking for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.Maskhadov said Chechen officials had caught one of the captorsMonday and he told police where the hostages were being held. Butthat information reached the other captors, who decided to killtheir captives, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Maskhadov assaying.The chief executive of Granger Telecom, Ray Verth, said Tuesdaythat Chechen authorities had mounted a rescue attempt Monday nightthat went ``tragically wrong.'' No other details were available.He said the company had ``opened a dialogue with the kidnappersand received confirmation that the hostages were alive as recentlyas last week.''``Their murder is an appalling and barbaric act and our thoughtsgo out to the families to whom we offer our deepest condolences. Weare a small tightly-knit company and everyone here is in a state ofshock,'' Verth said outside company headquarters in Weybridge,south of London, where flags were flying at half-mast.Spokesmen at the British and New Zealand embassies in Moscowsaid they were checking on reports the four men had been killed,but could not comment. The British Foreign Ministry in London saidit was investigating urgently reports that bodies had been found.Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who isheading the investigation into the killings, said authorities hadseveral suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make anyprogress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.Eamon Hickey, the father of one of the missing men, said heheard the news and was hoping it would not be confirmed.``There is so much rumor and counter-rumor coming from out therethat we don't know what to think. Obviously we are hoping andpraying that it does not turn out to be true,'' he said at his homein England.Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men forthe past two months. British officials said they had not receivedany ransom demand for the missing men.Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow toChechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of itsindependence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya tounidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.``I am ready to answer before my people and the whole world forwhat happened,'' he was quoted as saying by the Interfax newsagency.Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common inChechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war forindependence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped inthe North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens offoreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.(ren/ml/adc)
