	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the remains of
four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village in the
breakaway region in southern Russia.
	   An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near the
village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kms (25 miles) west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. There was no sign of any bodies.
	   The heads were identified as those of the four foreigners by
Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when
they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny. He said
the bodies had not been found.
	   Chechen government officials at the scene refused to comment.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said the bodies of four men
had been recovered, but gave no further details.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for
the past two months. British officials said they had not received
any ransom demand for the missing men.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for
independence from Russia in 1996. But victims are rarely killed.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said.
