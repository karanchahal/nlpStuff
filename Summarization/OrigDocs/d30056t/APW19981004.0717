It appealed to Russian authorities ``for theircooperation for the safe and early return of the men.''One bodyguard and an unknown number of attackers were wounded inthe fire fight, the Interfax news agency said. Police weresearching regional hospitals for anyone coming in with gunshotwounds.The British Embassy in Moscow identified the four hostages asBritons Peter William Kennedy, Darren Eamonn Hickey, and RudolfFranz-Joseph Petschi, and Stanley Frederick James Shaw of NewZealand. They were working for Granger Telecom, a British firmbased in Waybridge, Surrey, that has been working with the Chechentelecommunications company, an embassy spokesman said.The kidnappers have not set conditions for the men's release,the spokesman said.The kidnapping took place only 500 meters (550 yards) from theanti-kidnapping department, Interfax said. Policemen heard theshots, but didn't react because gunfire is frequent in the eveningin Grozny, the report said.``Despite the fact that the government of Britain did notrecommend that its citizens visit Chechnya, these four came and didnot inform anybody about their presence, not even law enforcementbodies,'' Bargishev said.The British Foreign Office said that Britons have been advisednot to go to Chechnya for the last 4 1/2 years.The incident ``will seriously slow down the plan for Chechnya'srevival,'' said Leon Wascinski, head of the Chechen mission of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according toInterfax.The kidnappers ``whoever they are, are acting in defiance of theinterests of the Chechen people and are doing so deliberately,'' hesaid.The kidnapping came just two weeks after Chechen warlordsreleased two British charity workers, ending the pair's 14 monthsof captivity in the turbulent republic in Russia's northernCaucasus region.Hundreds of Russian and foreign citizens have been abducted bygangs seeking ransom since the 1994-1996 independence war withRussia, and dozens remain held.Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's government has been unableto stem kidnappings that have become a steady business for somecriminal gangs.Chechnya considers itself independent and has been running itsown affairs since Russian troops left two years ago. Moscow saysthat Chechnya remains part of Russia but has no control over itsaffairs.(pvs/lon/ji)
