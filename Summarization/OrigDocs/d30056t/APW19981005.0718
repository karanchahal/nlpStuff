	   LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that the
British phone company whose four employees were kidnapped in
Chechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw from
Russia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.
	   ``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were known
to the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they took
themselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world and
people have to take mature decisions.''
	   The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probably
the world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought its
staff would be well-protected because they were working on a
government contract to install a telecommunications system.
	   Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and Rudolph
Petschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger. The
British company said the fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, may
have been employed directly by Chechen Telecom, which has offered a
reward for information about the kidnapping.
	   The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with their
bodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand for the four
men.
	   ``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visits
to Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecom
chief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.
	   Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said the
company had considered the contract, worth several million dollars,
justified the risk. The company was 12 months into a five-year
contract to install 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Hickey had been in the region since early August and was due
back in Britain this week, said Verth. Shaw had been in Chechnya
only a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.
	   ``None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went
_ they knew the risks,'' said Verth. ``We understood and believed
they were well catered for because we were contracted with the
Chechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety,
which obviously has not occurred.''
	   Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the men
released.
	   Hickey's sister said Monday his family is devastated. ``He was
just out there doing a job to help the country get their
communications back,'' said a tearful Deborah Hickey, 21.
	   Hickey, who is single and lives with his parents at Thames
Ditton, south of London, had been to Chechnya twice before, she
said, ``and he thought there was no danger at all,'' despite having
heard gunfire on a previous trip _ ``he said that was part of it.''
	   She did not blame Granger. ``Darren is old enough to make his
own decision to go out there or not,'' she said.
	   The Russian news agency ITAR-Tass on Monday quoted Magomed
Magomadov, Chechen deputy procurator-general, as saying one of the
kidnappers was wounded and received treatment at the district
hospital in Urus-Martan.
	   The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlords
released two British charity workers who had been held for 14
months.
	   London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latest
kidnappings ``cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to have
paid no ransom'' to secure the release of the charity workers.
