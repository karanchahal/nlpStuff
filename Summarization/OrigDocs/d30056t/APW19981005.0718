LONDON (AP) _ A Foreign Office minister said Monday that theBritish phone company whose four employees were kidnapped inChechnya at the weekend was specifically warned to withdraw fromRussia's breakaway region, but ignored the advice.``The advice could not have been clearer, the risks were knownto the company and to the employees,'' said Foreign Office MinisterDerek Fatchett in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.``The fact that they ignored that advice is a decision they tookthemselves and is their responsibility ... It's a mature world andpeople have to take mature decisions.''The company, Granger Telecom, said it knew Chechnya was probablythe world's most dangerous place for kidnapping but thought itsstaff would be well-protected because they were working on agovernment contract to install a telecommunications system.Three of the kidnaped men, Britons Darren Hickey and RudolphPetschi and New Zealander Stanley Shaw, worked for Granger. TheBritish company said the fourth hostage, Briton Peter Kennedy, mayhave been employed directly by Chechen Telecom, which has offered areward for information about the kidnapping.The men were seized early Saturday after a shoot-out with theirbodyguards. There was no word on any ransom demand for the fourmen.``We had a general advice from the Foreign Office about visitsto Chechnya but no specific advice about us,'' Granger Telecomchief executive Ray Verth told the BBC.Verth, who has now suspended operations in Chechnya, said thecompany had considered the contract, worth several million dollars,justified the risk. The company was 12 months into a five-yearcontract to install 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.Hickey had been in the region since early August and was dueback in Britain this week, said Verth. Shaw had been in Chechnyaonly a week and Petschi for 2 1/2 weeks.``None of our employees were forced to go, they voluntarily went_ they knew the risks,'' said Verth. ``We understood and believedthey were well catered for because we were contracted with theChechen government and Chechen Telecom, who guaranteed our safety,which obviously has not occurred.''Fatchett said Britain would do all it could to get the menreleased.Hickey's sister said Monday his family is devastated. ``He wasjust out there doing a job to help the country get theircommunications back,'' said a tearful Deborah Hickey, 21.Hickey, who is single and lives with his parents at ThamesDitton, south of London, had been to Chechnya twice before, shesaid, ``and he thought there was no danger at all,'' despite havingheard gunfire on a previous trip _ ``he said that was part of it.''She did not blame Granger. ``Darren is old enough to make hisown decision to go out there or not,'' she said.The Russian news agency ITAR-Tass on Monday quoted MagomedMagomadov, Chechen deputy procurator-general, as saying one of thekidnappers was wounded and received treatment at the districthospital in Urus-Martan.The men were seized just two weeks after Chechen warlordsreleased two British charity workers who had been held for 14months.London's Guardian newspaper said Monday that the latestkidnappings ``cast fresh doubt on Foreign Office claims to havepaid no ransom'' to secure the release of the charity workers.(mj-scl)
