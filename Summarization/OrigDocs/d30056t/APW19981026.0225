	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a car carrying a senior Muslim
cleric in breakaway Chechnya on Thursday, but he was not hurt,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Mufti Akhmad Khadzhi Kadirov was approaching his home in the
Chechen capital of Grozny when the bomb went off under his Mercedes
600, wounding his driver, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   Kadirov and his bodyguard managed to scramble out of the burning
car after the blast, which also destroyed a small building and blew
out windows nearby.
	   The attack came one day after a similar car bomb killed
Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, Shadid Bargishev.
	   Anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on Bargishev's
promise to launch an all-out offensive against hostage-takers, and
his recent success in securing the release of several captives,
including a British couple and 24 Russian soldiers.
	   ``The accident is a result of the work of the (anti-kidnapping)
department,'' said Husein Zabrailov, an investigator who worked
with Bargishev.
	   Chechnya's first deputy security minister, Abu Movsayev, said
that the Russian military may have been behind the killing.
Bargishev had recently challenged a claim by the Russian prosecutor
general's office that it had freed the Russian servicemen from
captivity, Movsayev said.
	   Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry in the southern Russian region
of Dagestan offered Monday to help combat hostage-taking in
neighboring Chechnya after the attack on Bargishev, ITAR-Tass said,
citing the ministry's press center.
	   Chechnya, where rebels fought a bloody independence war against
Russia in 1994-96, conducts its own affairs and has seen a sharp
rise in violent crime and hostage-taking, usually by criminal gangs
for ransom.
	   Dagestan suffers from its own ethnic conflicts, and has also
been hit by spillover violence and kidnappings by armed gangs in
Chechnya.
	   More than 100 people are still being held captive in Chechnya,
including three Britons, a New Zealander and a Turk, according to
Interfax.
