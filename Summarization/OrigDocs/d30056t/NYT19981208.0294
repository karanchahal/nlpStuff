MOSCOW _ The severed heads of four kidnapping victims _identified as three Britons and a New Zealander _ were foundTuesday on the side of a road in Chechnya, the breakaway region onRussia's southern border that emerged undefeated from a brutal wartwo years ago only to be engulfed by a wave of kidnappings andcrime.The gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about thevolatile situation in the region, which spun out of Moscow'scontrol long ago. Until now, local kidnappers have usually kepttheir hostages alive in hopes of receiving ransom money, which hasbecome a major source of income in an economy devastated byRussia's 21-month war against Chechen secessionists.Although the corpses have not yet been found, Chechen officialssaid Tuesday that they had been able to identify the victims asfour employees of a British telecommunications company. They werekidnapped from their house in the Chechen capital, Grozny, by twodozen armed men on Oct. 3, after a shootout with their bodyguards.The British government, in a statement Tuesday night condemningthe ``repugnant murders,'' said it was awaiting final confirmationof the victims' identity.``It is a horrifying crime, committed against the internationalcommunity,'' said Manolis Chikhkiyev, an aide to Ruslan Aushev,president of Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya. ``Ordinarycriminals wouldn't kill their hostages, which means that thissituation is much deeper and more complex.''An estimated 100 kidnap victims _ including several foreigners,as well as Russian servicemen _ are still being held in Chechnyaand neighboring regions in the northern Caucasus. In neighboringDagestan, kidnappers seized Herbert Gregg, an American teacher, onNov. 12 as he was leaving a local orphanage. His whereabouts areunknown.In recent months, the Chechen government has mounted a newcampaign to crack down on the kidnapping gangs, an effort that wasset back in October by a car bomb that killed the leader of itsspecial anti-terrorist squad.The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, has accused hispolitical opposition and ``foreign agents'' of using kidnapping asa weapon in its campaign to unseat him. But the crime wave is alsoattributed to competing local chieftans, Muslim extremists andother groups that have been feeding off the lawlessness and anarchythat has swept the region.Last October, a Russian official, Akmal Saidov, was foundstrangled to death several days after he had been abducted. Themotive was judged to be political after a note signed by the``wolves of Islam'' was reportedly found on his body, vowing deathto those who work for the Russian secret service.Fear of kidnapping has left Chechnya isolated from the rest ofthe world, as journalists, aid workers and foreign investors keep awary distance from a region now so impoverished that according toone local resident, some people are reduced to a diet of animalfeed.Yelena Masyuk, one of three Russian television journalistkidnapped and then released last year after payment of $2 millionin ransom, said at an international conference last May that thekidnappings had cost Chechnya the sympathy it had won when Russiantroops were bombing its capital and killing its civilians.``Chechens made $16 million on journalists last year, but theylost much more,'' she said. ``They lost the journalists' confidencethat they had had during the war.'' The result, she said, was ``aninformation blockade'' against the region and its 1 millioninhabitants.In the meantime, the Russian government, while refusing torecognize Chechen independence, has virtually no authority in theregion, and has dispersed little of the money it pledged forpostwar reconstruction.There have been successes in the war against the kidnappers _such as the release last month of President Boris Yeltsin'spersonal envoy to the region, Valentin Vlasov, after six months ofcaptivity.In the last two months, 55 Russian servicemen who had been heldcaptive have been returned to Moscow. And in September, a pair ofBritish aid workers were flown back to England, where they toldharrowing tales of abuse by their captors.Most released hostages have reported that their captors werecareful to keep them alive, if barely, so as to be able to collecttheir reward. One hostage, released this year after several monthsof captivity and speaking on condition of anonymity, describedbeing held in cold, wet basements, wearing the same set of clothesuntil they rotted on his body.Masked guards would deliver meager food rations at irregularintervals, and periodically move their prisoners to differentlocations, always at night. In his case, the motive for thekidnapping was clear. ``Their goal was only money,'' he said, ``andthey don't hide this.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)But even the hostage releases have only added fuel to thepolitically charged atmosphere in the region, as competing groupsaccuse each other of getting rich on the ransoms. Last month,Maskhadov accused a Russian financier, Boris Berezovsky, of fuelingthe kidnapping industry by paying out huge ransoms.Berezovsky _ who has played an open role in negotiating therelease of a number of hostages _ has routinely denied the charges,although he has said he provided humanitarian assistance, computersand textbooks to Chechnya in an effort to secure good will.``I tried to do everything possible on my side to stop thismess,'' he said Tuesday. ``Until this case, we were lucky.''Russian Interior Ministry officials have insisted that Vlasovwas released after a special operation mounted with the aid oftroops from Ingushetia, without the participation of any Chechenforces. However, Chechen officials contend that in this case, too,a ransom was paid. ``Money has been paid in every case,'' saidSharip Yusupov, a Chechen living in Moscow, who for five years wasChechnya's representative in the Russian capital.Yusupov said he thought the brazen killing of the fourtelecommunications specialists was a sign that the kidnappers nolonger expect to get ransom money from Russian officials. ``Thekidnapping industry is no longer profitable,'' he said, ``whichleft these people without a `master.' They were caught in asqueeze.''According to another theory, the kidnappers may have killedtheir victims because they feared they were about to be caught.Maskhadov, at a news conference in Grozny Tuesday, said that acaptured suspect had begun to give information last week about thelocation of the kidnappers. In London, a spokesman for GrangerTelecom, the British company that employed the men, said they hadhad word last week that the hostages were safe.
