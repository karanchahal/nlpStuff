	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The British Embassy in Moscow has received no
direct information about three Britons and a New Zealander
kidnapped in breakaway Chechnya nearly two weeks ago, an embassy
official said Wednesday.
	   No ransom demands have been made for the hostages, said an
embassy spokeswoman, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The hostages _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were kidnapped on Oct. 3.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
	   Chechnya's security forces launched a 10-day crackdown last
week, seeking to capture rebel armed groups and possibly find leads
to the hostages.
	   A particularly thorough search was being conducted in Chechnya's
mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held. No trace of
the Britons and the New Zealander have been found, Chechen
officials have said.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.
	   Since the beginning of 1998, 176 people have been kidnapped in
the North Caucasus region of Russia, including dozens of
foreigners, and 90 of them released, officials have said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Another high-profile hostage, Russian presidential envoy
Valentin Vlasov, who was kidnapped on May 1, remains missing.
