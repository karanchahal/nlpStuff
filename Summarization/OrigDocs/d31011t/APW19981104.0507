MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Weak consumer demand is expected tohave lowered inflation pressure on all commodity groups in thePhilippines in October, economists said Wednesday.The economists said they expect October inflation to be 9.8percent year-on-year, down from 10 percent in September. The datais to be released Thursday.In the nine months to September, inflation averaged 9.4 percent,lower than the government's target of 10 percent for the year.Inflation hit double-digit levels in May for the first time innearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.An economic slowdown triggered by the regional financial crisishas caused demand for most consumer items, including basiccommodities, to decline over the past few months. Food prices,which have a hefty weighting on the consumer prices index, havebeen softening since August.``With the weak economy, consumers are being very cautious withtheir purchases _ and most people (are) sticking to very tightbudgets,'' said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus SecuritiesCorp.During the second quarter of the year, the country's grossnational product shrank 0.7 percent, its first contraction in fiveyears. Economists expect either no growth or a contraction in thethird quarter.The impact of droughts caused by the El Nino weather condition,which lowered growth in the first half, will not be reflected inthe October inflation data, economists say.``Even if some provinces are still recovering from the effectsof the drought, most major agricultural producing provinces havesince resumed normal activities,'' said Luz Lorenzo, research headat ATR Securities Inc.Lorenzo said, however, that recent typhoons could causeinflationary pressures over the next two months.The Philippines is still recovering from the effects of twotyphoons last month that destroyed some 4 billion pesos (dlrs 100million) worth of crops. The areas hardest hit by the typhoonsaccount for 55 percent of the country's gross domestic product.Lorenzo doesn't expect the effect of the typhoons on consumerprices will be dramatic since the government has said it isprepared to import basic commodities such as rice, sugar and cornto make up for any supply shortfall.``As long as the government is ready to import, prices willremain stable,'' she said.Some economists now expect inflation to average 9.6 percent thisyear, lower than the government's target of 10 percent.
