	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Weak consumer demand is expected to
have lowered inflation pressure on all commodity groups in the
Philippines in October, economists said Wednesday.
	   The economists said they expect October inflation to be 9.8
percent year-on-year, down from 10 percent in September. The data
is to be released Thursday.
	   In the nine months to September, inflation averaged 9.4 percent,
lower than the government's target of 10 percent for the year.
Inflation hit double-digit levels in May for the first time in
nearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
	   An economic slowdown triggered by the regional financial crisis
has caused demand for most consumer items, including basic
commodities, to decline over the past few months. Food prices,
which have a hefty weighting on the consumer prices index, have
been softening since August.
	   ``With the weak economy, consumers are being very cautious with
their purchases _ and most people (are) sticking to very tight
budgets,'' said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities
Corp.
	   During the second quarter of the year, the country's gross
national product shrank 0.7 percent, its first contraction in five
years. Economists expect either no growth or a contraction in the
third quarter.
	   The impact of droughts caused by the El Nino weather condition,
which lowered growth in the first half, will not be reflected in
the October inflation data, economists say.
	   ``Even if some provinces are still recovering from the effects
of the drought, most major agricultural producing provinces have
since resumed normal activities,'' said Luz Lorenzo, research head
at ATR Securities Inc.
	   Lorenzo said, however, that recent typhoons could cause
inflationary pressures over the next two months.
	   The Philippines is still recovering from the effects of two
typhoons last month that destroyed some 4 billion pesos (dlrs 100
million) worth of crops. The areas hardest hit by the typhoons
account for 55 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Lorenzo doesn't expect the effect of the typhoons on consumer
prices will be dramatic since the government has said it is
prepared to import basic commodities such as rice, sugar and corn
to make up for any supply shortfall.
	   ``As long as the government is ready to import, prices will
remain stable,'' she said.
	   Some economists now expect inflation to average 9.6 percent this
year, lower than the government's target of 10 percent.
