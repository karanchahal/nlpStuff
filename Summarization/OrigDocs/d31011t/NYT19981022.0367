NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;Snow advisories were issued Thursday for the San Juan Mountainsin southeast Colorado as moist air drawn northward by a distantupper-level low-pressure system over northern Nevada was forced toascend the sloping terrain. On Friday, the upper-level low willweaken as it migrates slowly into western Montana, touching offscattered showers in the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin.Farther south, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms willdevelop over the southern Rockies in Arizona, New Mexico andwestern Colorado as residual moist air left in the wake of theMontana low is lifted over the mountainous terrain.A chilly, frosty morning over the middle Mississippi and Ohiovalleys will be followed by a sunny, mild afternoon under theauspices of a sprawling high- pressure system centered oversoutheast Missouri. The clockwise circulation of air around thebehemoth high will stretch from New England to Florida.Along Florida's east coast, ocean winds averaging 15 to 30 mphwill pile up water at spots along beaches, raising the risk thatdangerous rip currents will develop. Gusts to 40 mph are possiblein spots. Meanwhile, widely separated showers and thunderstormswill form over the peninsula, fueled by inbound ocean moisture.Across New England, winds from the west will send milder aireastward from the Great Lakes. However, a warm front marking theleading edge of the advancing milder air will meet with someresistance, paving the way for spotty showers across northern NewEngland.Focus: Stormy PhilippinesSupertyphoon Babs, armed with winds over 150 mph, slammed intothe Philippine island of Luzon on Wednesday. The fierce landfallfollowed on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, which lashed Luzon overa week ago. The long north-to-south span of the Philippines placesthe chain squarely within the main migration route of typhoons inthe western Pacific, which boasts a higher frequency of tropicalstorms than any other basin in the world. The primary reasons forthe high frequency of storms are the large expanse of very warmwater and favorably steady upper-level winds from the east.
