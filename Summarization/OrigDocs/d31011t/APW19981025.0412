	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Hong Kong Observatory said that at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT), the
typhoon, packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), was centered
about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of the territory. It was
moving at about 10 kph (6.2 mph) toward the south China coast.
	   The storm was expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Tuesday,
the observatory said.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording
more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours,
weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from
their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One-third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much
of nearby Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and
trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as gusts of 104 kph (64
mph) were recorded in some places.
	   The government opened several shelters for those seeking refuge
from the storm.
	   Hong Kong beaches were ordered closed because of rough seas, and
fishing boats sought shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the
death toll from Babs rose to 156 Sunday. The fatalities included 71
people who died in landslides in hard-hit Catanduanes island and 41
people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in
nearby Camarines Sur province.
	   Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in
Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged. Residents
began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.
