	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs headed toward southern
China Friday after battering the central and northern Philippines
with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 82 people, flattened
crops, and drove more than 100,000 people from their homes.
	   The toll was expected to rise as contacts are restored with
remote areas where roads were blocked by landslides and flooding,
and telephone service was knocked out by strong winds.
	   Among the worst-hit areas was the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where Babs first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil Defense
director Renato Arevalo said. Seventeen others died in landslides
in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
	   Another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon
province, also part of the Bicol region, Arevalo said.
	   More than 100,000 people in the area were forced to flee their
homes, Red Cross officials said. Tens of thousands of others were
stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included six drownings, two people hit by falling
trees, two girls buried by landslides in central Iloilo province, a
man who died of shock, and a fireman crushed after his van
overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
	   In Manila, most government offices closed at noon because of the
storm. President Joseph Estrada ordered a forced evacuation of slum
dwellers living near swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were removed from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their flooded homes, a few possessions piled next to them. Others
used tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   In northern Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded
onto the roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs'
floodwaters. About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were
destroyed in the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   Late Friday, the storm was centered over the South China Sea,
140 kilometers (88 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
