About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice weredestroyed in the province, officials said.Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano withheavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches ofvolcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the materialwas carried safely away by swollen rivers.Late Friday, the storm was centered over the South China Sea,140 kilometers (88 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City inPangasinan province, weather officials said.
