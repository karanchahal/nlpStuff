SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced towardsouthern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destructionon the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died andhundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes andthree other other provinces and a city in the worst hit area on thesouthern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.He was expected to add more provinces to the list once the fullextent of the damage was determined. Officials in calamity zoneswill be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices ofcommodities with little red tape.Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property wouldrise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked bylandslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China,packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said.At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), it was located about 370 kilometers (230miles) west-northwest of Vigan in Ilocos Sur province. Moving at 11kph (7 mph), it is expected to be 300 kilometers (187 miles)south-southeast of Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon.Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 wereattributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs firstlanded on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing therelief and rescue work.The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut andabaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attemptedto escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind thevillage.The powerful winds flattened the abaca and tore away the leavesof the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas withblown-away tops. Virtually every house was damaged.The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.``Entire families were killed,'' said Eddie Tapel, a localofficial. ``Many children will have to quit school because theirfamilies have no more income.''Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Surprovince and another 102 people were injured by flying debris inSorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol regionalong the Philippines' eastern coast.More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of theirhomes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of otherswere stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit byfalling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two childrenkilled by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a firemancrushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,officials said.In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homesand into government shelters.Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under waterearly Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatussaid.Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavyrain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic materialfrom the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safelyaway by swollen rivers.It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in thenorthern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
