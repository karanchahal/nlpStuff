MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The price of cooking oil in thePhilippines has risen drastically this month because of retailersspeculating on a shortfall in copra production, the government saidThursday.Norberto Boceta, deputy administrator of the Philippine CoconutAuthority, said the price of cooking oil has jumped by as much as50 percent this month from prices posted in the first quarter.Boceta said in a letter to the Department of Trade and Industrythat the increase was spurred by retailers speculating on a``perceived copra production shortfall due to the effects of ElNino and the two super typhoons.''Coconut oil is the main ingredient in cooking oil manufacturedin the Philippines. It is extracted from copra, the dried whitemeat of the coconut.The country's copra production is expected to drop below 2million metric tons this year as a result of the drought brought bythe El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit coconut farms during thelatter part of 1997.The two typhoons that recently hit the country, Zeb and Babs,have also hurt coconut crops. Babs, in particular, ravaged theBicol region, a large coconut-producing area.With hefty 1997 carry-over stocks gradually depleting, thelosses brought by El Nino and the typhoons are now affecting thesupply of copra.Boceta said speculator activity also takes into account that thelast quarter of the year ordinarily is a lean harvest season.But Boceta is confident that the inflated market will soon giveway to supply and demand dynamics.A spokeswoman for the coconut administration office said theprice increase only affects local consumers and that the situationis likely to normalize in a few weeks.
