RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Cruising at 19,000 feet on Saturday in thecockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart fromGaza's new international airport, Capt. Jamal Al-How from theJabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.``At this historic moment, taking off for the first time inhistory from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the worldcannot express my pride and joy,'' he declared. ``I thank theheroic Palestinian people, which sacrificed everything it had sothat we could reach this moment.''Earlier, applause rang through the cabin as the 48-seat Fokker50 propeller plane, painted with the Palestinian national colors ofred, green, black and white, took to the air. Mohammad Abdel Salamfrom Bethlehem, the steward, greeted the passengers of Flight 152,inaugurating regular service from the Gaza airport, which wasceremonially opened last month.``Welcome aboard the first flight from Yasser ArafatInternational Airport, bound for Amman,'' Abdel Salam said over theloudspeaker. ``Thank you for choosing Palestinian Airlines, and wewish you all a pleasant flight.''Times have changed. In the not-too-distant past, the combinationof the words ``Palestinian'' and ``airplane'' evoked images ofgun-waving hijackers from the PLO. Now the Palestinians are runningtheir own airline from Gaza, with planes flown by former PLOpilots, and Palestinian security men checking bags and passengersfor would-be terrorists.Established in 1996, the tiny Palestinian airline was anoutgrowth of the accords with Israel on Palestinian self-rule. Ithas two Fokker 50s received from the Netherlands, and a Boeing 727donated by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, which is stillbeing prepared for service.Starting operations in 1997 without a home airport, theairline's first flights left from Port Said in Egypt, ferryingMuslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Regular service began a few monthslater from the Egyptian town of El Arish to Amman and to the SaudiArabian city of Jidda. Departing passengers had to make anight-long trek by bus from Gaza to El Arish, moving slowly throughPalestinian, Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints to board flights thattook far less time than the ground journey.Flying from Gaza for the first time on Saturday, passengersremarked on the simple convenience of going directly from home totheir local airport, avoiding Israeli interrogations and securitychecks at border crossings and at Ben-Gurion airport near Tel Aviv,Israel. It enhanced their sense that, while there was noPalestinian state yet, something like one was emerging from theoften-troubled negotiations with Israel.``I drove here with my family, like anyone else in the world,''said Ahmad al-Ghandour, a department head in the PalestinianAuthority. ``I'm leaving like people do everywhere else, on yourown plane, with your own passport.''Mahfouz Othman, a psychiatrist from Rafah, said that he wasrelieved of the anxiety that often plagued his departures in thepast, when he was worried that he might be turned back or detained.``I feel that I'm keeping my dignity; these are Palestinians likeus,'' he said as he handed his passport to a Palestinian policeofficer. ``At a personal, human level, this is a changing point inour lives.''Not entirely. A short while after Othman spoke, Palestiniansecurity officers and Israeli counterparts keeping watch at theairport got into a dispute about departure procedures, delayingtake-off for three-and-a-half hours.Fayez Zaidan, the airline chairman, came to the passenger loungeto encourage his customers. ``We are with you facing theIsraelis,'' he told them. ``This is your airport.'' In the end, thepassengers were bused to the adjacent Rafah border terminal wherethey went through passport control under Israeli supervision,before returning to the plane. A few hours later, returningpassengers were delayed two hours at the same terminal for Israelisecurity and document checks.But the first-day hitches did not mar the patriotic spirit onthe first flight from Gaza, and its passengers were greeted withroses in Amman. Regular flights to Jidda and Cairo, Egypt, arescheduled to start in the next few days. The airline expects tocarry thousands to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia inMarch, and there are long-range plans to expand service to Cyprus,Turkey and Greece.``I always imagined that it would come,'' said Zaidan, who isalso head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority. ``There weremany obstacles and difficulties. I'm very happy that I couldachieve this goal of establishing a civil aviation authority fromzero, an airport from zero, an airline from zero. We did it.''The company has sent some of its 400 employees to train inMorocco and Jordan, but the core of its crews and staff served inwhat was once the air wing of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, or worked in airlines in the Arab world.Palestinians also gained experience in the 1980s in MaldivesAirways, which was effectively owned by the PLO, and in Air Bissau,a government-owned carrier in Africa in which the PLO was a majorpartner.When it was still a guerrilla movement, the PLO sent volunteersto flight academies in Pakistan and Yugoslavia, and in the 1980s,Palestinian fighter pilots served in the air forces of Syria, Libyaand Yemen. The PLO air fleet consisted then of small transportplanes and helicopters, used mostly for travel between theorganization's headquarters.``Like any revolution struggling for freedom, we were fightingfor the liberation of Palestine,'' said Yassin al-Hawamdi, a pilot.``Now we're building up a state.''For now, however, Palestinians do not control their skies.Take-offs and landings must be reported to the Israelis. Flightsfrom Gaza are barred from crossing Israel's southern air-spacebecause there are military installations en route, compellingflights to Amman to detour over the Sinai peninsula, meaning thatthey take about 90 minutes. Sophisticated landing equipment isstill being held in an Israeli port, and planes only land and takeoff at the Gaza airport in daylight.Yet for the Palestinian Airlines staff, operating their nationalcarrier from their soil is a source of great satisfaction.``I have traveled everywhere, to 70 countries,'' said AbdelSalam, the steward, who worked 15 years for Kuwait Airways. ``Now Ifeel different. I'm taking care of my own people. We waited a longtime to realize our dream.''
