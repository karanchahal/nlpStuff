 
   RAFAH, Gaza _ Palestinians celebrated with euphoria the
long-delayed opening of their international airport Tuesday as a
parade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to a
literal red-carpet landing in the flatlands of Gaza.
 
 
   With brass bands, bag-pipes and grandiloquent speeches,
Palestinian officials made it clear that they see the sleekly
modern airport as the most concrete symbol yet of their fledgling
sovereignty. The high emotion and pageantry Tuesday stood in stark
contrast to the muted response last week to an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank.
 
 
   ``This is my day of great joy as a Palestinian refugee,'' said
Ahmad Abdel Rachman, the general secretary of the Palestinian
Cabinet. ``I am standing on Palestinian soil, and I have an
airport, I have a flag, I have an airplane. This is our path to the
independent Palestinian state.''
 
 
   The airport, a potential economic lifeline to the depressed Gaza
Strip, was completed more than a year ago, with about $60 million
in grants from Egypt and Morocco as well as from Spain and other
European Union countries. But its fate became mired in the
stalemated peace talks until the peace memorandum signed in
Washington last month provided a breakthrough.
 
 
   The Gaza International Airport, with 400 employees, will open
for regular business next week. Royal Air Maroc is expected to
begin Gaza-Casablanca service. And the Palestinian National Airline
will fly routes to Amman, Cairo and Jidda with three planes: two
Fokker 50s donated by the Netherlands, and a 20-year-old Boeing 727
given by Saudi Prince Walled bin Talal. There are 20 pilots, most
with Egyptian flying certificates.
 
 
   ``It may look like a little airport to you, but to us, it's
bigger than John F. Kennedy,'' said Nabil Shurafa, a travel agent
in Gaza City.
 
 
   The alabaster towers of the new airport rise from a particularly
hardscrabble stretch of southern Gaza near the Egyptian border.
Thousands of local residents pushed at its gates Tuesday morning,
begging to be let into the closed ceremony, gaping at the
elaborate, Moroccan-style architecture, and ducking with the whoosh
of each landing plane.
 
 
   For Mafa Barbakh, an elderly woman wrapped in black from head to
toe, the moment was too important to experience from afar. Like
many, she said she had never even seen a plane before. She wanted
to be on the tarmac, to ululate and raise her hands to the heavens.
She finally did, when the gates were opened and the Palestinians
swarmed the grounds _ chanting, dancing, laying down prayer rugs
and otherwise making it their own.
 
 
   ``I want to fly to Mecca,'' she said. ``I hope God gives me this
gift, to go up in the sky like a bird, on Palestinian wings. Hey,
we have Palestinian passports now. I can travel with my Palestinian
passport on a Palestinian plane. This is Palestine!''
 
 
   At 8:30 a.m., with a punctuality remarkable for Gaza, the first
of seven planes landed: a white Airbus from Egypt, disgorging
government officials and three actors. One, a comedian, Adel Imam,
caused the the Palestine National Airline's entire staff of flight
attendants _ 18 women in navy pants suits and Muslim head scarves _
to jump up and down and squeal.
 
 
   Aircraft carrying delegations from other principal donors to the
project followed: the Jordanians, the Moroccans, the Spanish, the
Dutch and, aboard an Israeli charter, some European Union
officials. The bagpipes, a holdover from the days of the British
Mandate, seemed a disconcerting greeting to many who strode down
the red carpet past upturned bayonets on their way into the V.I.P.
lounge to see Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
 
 
   Last week, the airport was named Yasser Arafat International
Airport by Arafat's aides, and signs were duly posted. But the
Palestinian leader was not pleased. The signs were taken down, and
the original entry banner restrung: Gaza International Airport, it
said Tuesday.
 
 
   The V.I.P. lounge, a lavish building decorated with Moroccan
mosaics, crystal chandeliers and a fountain, bears a gilded dome
atop its roof, meant to echo the Dome of the Rock Mosque in
Jerusalem. In a way that irked Israeli officials, Jerusalem was
itself a constant theme as Palestinian officials got swept away by
the moment.
 
 
   ``God willing, we will open the Jerusalem Airport next,'' Arafat
said. ``God willing, we will land soon at the Jerusalem Airport.''
 
 
   The fate of Jerusalem will be debated in the final-status peace
talks, which began last week. The Israelis say it will remain
undivided, but the Palestinians want to reclaim East Jerusalem,
annexed by Israel in 1967, as the capital of their eventual state.
 
 
   Last week, under the peace memorandum signed in Washington, the
first phase of a three-part Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
tripled the amount of territory under complete Palestinian control.
Still, it was sparsely populated, rural land dotted with small
towns and villages. The Palestinian response was quiet, and Arafat
received only two calls of congratulations from world leaders: one
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the other from a
Norwegian official.
 
 
   On Tuesday, in contrast, a who's who of the Palestinian
leadership, flanked by dignitaries from the Arab world and Europe,
declared the airport's opening a milestone, while the Palestinian
police danced with their rifles in the air. The officials said it
would ease the claustrophobia of Gazans, who feel locked into their
dusty strip of territory by Israeli border checkpoints most do not
have permits to cross.
 

 
   ``These people in Gaza have been living in this ghetto since
1948,'' Abdel Rachman said, talking with foreign reporters. ``More
than 60 to 70 percent have never left. Now with free access to the
rest of the world, they will feel they're human, like all of you.''
 
 
   During the year-and-a-half delay before the airport opened, the
Palestinian airline operated on a limited basis out of El Arish in
Egypt. Passengers traveled by bus across the border and often
waited hours before departure. Most business travelers flew out of
Cairo; those who imported goods relied on Israeli ports or the
airport in Tel Aviv.
 
 
   ``Now I'll be able to travel like a regular businessman, on
overnight trips,'' Sayeed el-Madhoun, who owns a floor-covering
company, said while videotaping the ceremony. ``And it'll make it
easier and cheaper to bring materials in and out.''
 
 
   When the airport opens for regular service next week, there will
still be difficulties to resolve.
 
 
   Some $15 million in donated equipment, including radar and
high-tech air-traffic-control devices, has been held up in a
dispute between Israel and the donor nations. Most of it has sat in
the port of Ashdod for the last year. Now the Port Authority of
Israel is demanding $650,000 in storage fees to release it.
 
 
   And about $3 million in night-landing equipment donated by
Germany has been held in Hamburg because the Germans fear similar
difficulties with Israeli customs and security officials.
 
 
   As a result, the airport will at first handle only daylight
flights.
 
 
   Also, the Israelis will retain considerable control over routes,
flight schedules and security. Israeli aviation officials, in fact,
have described the Gaza airport as a new airport under Israel's
jurisdiction.
 
 
   As they do at some of the land crossings into Jordan, the
Israelis will operate a kind of shadow document-checking system.
Palestinian officials will review passengers' documents, passing
them behind a screen to Israelis.
 
 
   Fadda Jabr, a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority,
brushed aside those issues as mere ``technical difficulties.''
 
 
   ``Today is the concrete evidence of the success of the camp of
peace,'' he said. ``Now the ink of the agreement has turned into
something we can see, we can touch and we can admire. Lovely, isn't
it?''
