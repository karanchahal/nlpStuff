RAFAH, Gaza _ Palestinians celebrated with euphoria thelong-delayed opening of their international airport Tuesday as aparade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to aliteral red-carpet landing in the flatlands of Gaza.With brass bands, bag-pipes and grandiloquent speeches,Palestinian officials made it clear that they see the sleeklymodern airport as the most concrete symbol yet of their fledglingsovereignty. The high emotion and pageantry Tuesday stood in starkcontrast to the muted response last week to an Israeli withdrawalfrom the West Bank.``This is my day of great joy as a Palestinian refugee,'' saidAhmad Abdel Rachman, the general secretary of the PalestinianCabinet. ``I am standing on Palestinian soil, and I have anairport, I have a flag, I have an airplane. This is our path to theindependent Palestinian state.''The airport, a potential economic lifeline to the depressed GazaStrip, was completed more than a year ago, with about $60 millionin grants from Egypt and Morocco as well as from Spain and otherEuropean Union countries. But its fate became mired in thestalemated peace talks until the peace memorandum signed inWashington last month provided a breakthrough.The Gaza International Airport, with 400 employees, will openfor regular business next week. Royal Air Maroc is expected tobegin Gaza-Casablanca service. And the Palestinian National Airlinewill fly routes to Amman, Cairo and Jidda with three planes: twoFokker 50s donated by the Netherlands, and a 20-year-old Boeing 727given by Saudi Prince Walled bin Talal. There are 20 pilots, mostwith Egyptian flying certificates.``It may look like a little airport to you, but to us, it'sbigger than John F. Kennedy,'' said Nabil Shurafa, a travel agentin Gaza City.The alabaster towers of the new airport rise from a particularlyhardscrabble stretch of southern Gaza near the Egyptian border.Thousands of local residents pushed at its gates Tuesday morning,begging to be let into the closed ceremony, gaping at theelaborate, Moroccan-style architecture, and ducking with the whooshof each landing plane.For Mafa Barbakh, an elderly woman wrapped in black from head totoe, the moment was too important to experience from afar. Likemany, she said she had never even seen a plane before. She wantedto be on the tarmac, to ululate and raise her hands to the heavens.She finally did, when the gates were opened and the Palestiniansswarmed the grounds _ chanting, dancing, laying down prayer rugsand otherwise making it their own.``I want to fly to Mecca,'' she said. ``I hope God gives me thisgift, to go up in the sky like a bird, on Palestinian wings. Hey,we have Palestinian passports now. I can travel with my Palestinianpassport on a Palestinian plane. This is Palestine!''At 8:30 a.m., with a punctuality remarkable for Gaza, the firstof seven planes landed: a white Airbus from Egypt, disgorginggovernment officials and three actors. One, a comedian, Adel Imam,caused the the Palestine National Airline's entire staff of flightattendants _ 18 women in navy pants suits and Muslim head scarves _to jump up and down and squeal.Aircraft carrying delegations from other principal donors to theproject followed: the Jordanians, the Moroccans, the Spanish, theDutch and, aboard an Israeli charter, some European Unionofficials. The bagpipes, a holdover from the days of the BritishMandate, seemed a disconcerting greeting to many who strode downthe red carpet past upturned bayonets on their way into the V.I.P.lounge to see Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.Last week, the airport was named Yasser Arafat InternationalAirport by Arafat's aides, and signs were duly posted. But thePalestinian leader was not pleased. The signs were taken down, andthe original entry banner restrung: Gaza International Airport, itsaid Tuesday.The V.I.P. lounge, a lavish building decorated with Moroccanmosaics, crystal chandeliers and a fountain, bears a gilded domeatop its roof, meant to echo the Dome of the Rock Mosque inJerusalem. In a way that irked Israeli officials, Jerusalem wasitself a constant theme as Palestinian officials got swept away bythe moment.``God willing, we will open the Jerusalem Airport next,'' Arafatsaid. ``God willing, we will land soon at the Jerusalem Airport.''The fate of Jerusalem will be debated in the final-status peacetalks, which began last week. The Israelis say it will remainundivided, but the Palestinians want to reclaim East Jerusalem,annexed by Israel in 1967, as the capital of their eventual state.Last week, under the peace memorandum signed in Washington, thefirst phase of a three-part Israeli withdrawal from the West Banktripled the amount of territory under complete Palestinian control.Still, it was sparsely populated, rural land dotted with smalltowns and villages. The Palestinian response was quiet, and Arafatreceived only two calls of congratulations from world leaders: onefrom Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the other from aNorwegian official.On Tuesday, in contrast, a who's who of the Palestinianleadership, flanked by dignitaries from the Arab world and Europe,declared the airport's opening a milestone, while the Palestinianpolice danced with their rifles in the air. The officials said itwould ease the claustrophobia of Gazans, who feel locked into theirdusty strip of territory by Israeli border checkpoints most do nothave permits to cross.(STORY CAN END HERE.

Now with free access to therest of the world, they will feel they're human, like all of you.''During the year-and-a-half delay before the airport opened, thePalestinian airline operated on a limited basis out of El Arish inEgypt. Passengers traveled by bus across the border and oftenwaited hours before departure. Most business travelers flew out ofCairo; those who imported goods relied on Israeli ports or theairport in Tel Aviv.``Now I'll be able to travel like a regular businessman, onovernight trips,'' Sayeed el-Madhoun, who owns a floor-coveringcompany, said while videotaping the ceremony. ``And it'll make iteasier and cheaper to bring materials in and out.''When the airport opens for regular service next week, there willstill be difficulties to resolve.Some $15 million in donated equipment, including radar andhigh-tech air-traffic-control devices, has been held up in adispute between Israel and the donor nations. Most of it has sat inthe port of Ashdod for the last year. Now the Port Authority ofIsrael is demanding $650,000 in storage fees to release it.And about $3 million in night-landing equipment donated byGermany has been held in Hamburg because the Germans fear similardifficulties with Israeli customs and security officials.As a result, the airport will at first handle only daylightflights.Also, the Israelis will retain considerable control over routes,flight schedules and security. Israeli aviation officials, in fact,have described the Gaza airport as a new airport under Israel'sjurisdiction.As they do at some of the land crossings into Jordan, theIsraelis will operate a kind of shadow document-checking system.Palestinian officials will review passengers' documents, passingthem behind a screen to Israelis.Fadda Jabr, a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority,brushed aside those issues as mere ``technical difficulties.''``Today is the concrete evidence of the success of the camp ofpeace,'' he said. ``Now the ink of the agreement has turned intosomething we can see, we can touch and we can admire. Lovely, isn'tit?''
