DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Taking a major step towardstatehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated GazaInternational Airport, their first gateway to the world, withcheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac inthe southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt).But the emotional highlight was the touchdown of the firstPalestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50. After landing, the pilotand co-pilot raised Palestinian flags high above their heads asthey descended the stairway. A chant of ``Allahu Akbar,'' or God isGreat, rose from of a crowd of thousands of Palestinians who hadpushed their way onto the airfield to join the celebrations.``You are a beautiful sight,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafatlater told the Palestinian crew in the VIP lounge lavishlydecorated with deep red Oriental carpets and wall mosaics.Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to thetarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan,Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights.``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinianstate,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.However, Israel continues to control the airspace and has theauthority to shut down the airfield at any time. It will monitorarriving passengers and cargo, and can keep travelers or goods outif it considers them a danger to Israeli security.Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority oversecurity had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.In a sign of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian securityagents approached the Egypt Air jet together Tuesday and collectedthe passports of the passengers, including Egyptian Cabinetministers and comedian Adel Imam, in white bags.Throughout the morning, there were spontaneous celebrations. Asa police marching band played bagpipes, airport workers, policemenand Cabinet ministers held each other by their hands and danced ina circle. Some kissed and embraced their neighbors, others wipedaway tears and several officers waved their rifles in the air.In one corner of the airfield, about 300 people gathered arounda man and a boy riding mules that moved to the beat of drums.The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubledPalestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowersand farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, oftenwith difficulties and delays.The airfield will also make it easier for Palestinians to travelabroad, although a majority of Gazans are probably too poor to beable to afford an air ticket.Until now, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed permissionto enter Israel and fly out of Ben Gurion International airportnear Tel Aviv. The other option was to travel by land to Jordan andcatch flights there.Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit tocross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Travel is expected tobecome easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gazaopens next month.Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use thePalestinian airport, citing security reasons. However, IsraeliForeign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might changein the future.The opening of the airport was negotiated during last month'sU.S.-sponsored Mideast summit near Washington. As part of theaccord, Israel also withdrew troops in the northern West Bank lastweek and released 250 Palestinian prisoners.A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to opennext month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinianseaport in Gaza are continuing.Gaza International, with the call letters LVGZ, was designed inan Oriental style with graceful arches and elaborate tiles importedfrom Morocco. The airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP loungeand a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter(4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabianext week.In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on someimprovisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controlsfor the control tower, are still held up at the Israeli port ofAshdod. Tuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by aportable control panel installed in a van.Despite its temporary shortcomings, many Palestinians considerthe airport a big step toward independence. For those living in thesmall, overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterraneanon one side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help easethe feeling of being trapped.``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli proceduresthat we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, who studieseconomics at Gaza City University and plans to fly next month toSaudi Arabia, for a pilgrimage to Mecca.&UR; kl
