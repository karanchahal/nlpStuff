JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has threatened to close down thePalestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeliofficial said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine thealready fragile peace process.Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli securityofficials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on anEgyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for thePalestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport AuthorityDirector Nir Yarkoni.``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestiniansthat if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' hetold The Associated Press.Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter sent Monday tochairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig. Gen.Fayez Zeidan.Zeidan was not immediately available for comment.Israel retains security control over flights arriving to GazaInternational Airport.The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accordsbrokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland inOctober, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone towardindependence and statehood.Since then, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing tocontain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords. ThePalestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement torelease Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.&UR; sb-rk
