TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a keyelection Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urgedIranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the19-year-old Islamic regime.The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its hourlong main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people toshow their ``brave presence'' at polling stations to elect theAssembly of Experts.Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-memberassembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus electsand supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final sayin government decisions.Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah KazemLankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``therevolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at ourregime.''Despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failedto draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the161 candidates _ all clergymen _ are hard-liners who were selectedby a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supportersof President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with widepopular support.Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader moreaccountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much morehands-off approach.The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power strugglein the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen whocontrol most of the major state institutions such as the judiciaryand security agencies.Since his elections last year, Khatami has stunned thehard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social,political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979Islamic Revolution installed the government of theologians.By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, theconservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stingingdefeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30million people voted for Khatami against a hard-line rival.But then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would lookbad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote toprotest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call intoquestion the legitimacy of the conservatives.Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keepthe most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such asMohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head ofthe Council of Guardians.The moderates also do not want their candidates _ few as theyare _ to suffer because of a low turnout.Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former PresidentHashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, whowants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and toopen its sessions to public.Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligiblevoters are expected to take part. Even the hard-line Abrar dailyestimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39percent.Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneiissued his final appeal Wednesday.``The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of theAssembly of Experts will inject a new life into the revolution,''he said.Some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around thecountry's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.First official results are not expected until Saturday.&UR; sf/vj
