TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday to elect a keyassembly expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen who favorunhindered powers for Iran's supreme leader.The state-controlled media reported an ``unprecedented andunique'' turnout but gave no figures. However, Associated Pressreporters found many polling stations empty and others with fewvoters.Friday's election is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whosejob is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currentlyheld by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters_ and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderateclerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a moreaccountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped Iransince his election last year.``We want to have a say in our destiny,'' said Farhad Qaemaqami,who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscaleFereshteh neighborhood. ``I will vote for somebody who will havesome kind of influence over the (supreme) leader.''But Khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even beforethe polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30of them moderates.Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out toreporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaranmeeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people thanwere allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose ourfavored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling boothdressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.He shook hands and chatted with election officials beforesitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel forthe Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote andauthorities expect to run out of ballot papers. ``People voted forIslam,'' the radio said. ``People's participation is unprecedentedand unique.''In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, peoplebraved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines atpolling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voterturnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from,unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people votedfor the reformist Khatami.A hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.``They are all liars. I am powerless to do anything against themso it's best to keep quiet,'' said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, auniversity student who said he didn't vote. ``They have alreadyselected the people they want to put in the assembly.''A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-linepolicies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installedthe rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social,political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly byhard-liners loathe to give up control over Iran's judiciary,security agencies and other key institutions.Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT). Firstofficial results are not expected until Saturday.
