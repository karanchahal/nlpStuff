TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's official media boasted about a hugeturnout in elections Friday for the council that oversees thecountry's supreme leader. But many polling stations were nearlyempty in Tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voterscomplained that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.State-controlled Tehran radio reported ``unprecedented andunique'' voting levels for the 86-member Assembly of Experts.The radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stationsacross the country, and electoral officers expected to run out ofballot papers.But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations aroundthe capital found turnout to be minimal. Only two polling stationshad voters waiting in line.The electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for atotal of three hours. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari also saidlate voters would not be turned away.Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the lowturnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates wereselected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled byconservatives.``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition waslimited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from takingpart in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press.Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting thepolls.``It makes no difference. They have already selected the peoplethey want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, auniversity student who didn't vote.A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she wasalso alienated from the polls.``The behavior of the Council of Guardians was very insultingbecause they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates ofour choice,'' she said.Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no privatebooths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had castempty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of themoderate President Mohammad Khatami.However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates becausethey ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution.''``We know that the revolution will have no problem if they arein charge,'' he said.Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, hasthe final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keepit that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling fora more accountable leader.Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political andmedia restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly byhard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutionssuch as the judiciary and the security agencies.Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at theHusseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people thanwere allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose ourfavored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran'sresults could be announced as late as Sunday, electoral authoritiessaid.
