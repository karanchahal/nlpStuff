TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading innational elections for a key assembly that elects and overseesIran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidatesin Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain theauthority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite clericwho has the final say in all matters.The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 ofthe 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations werenot given but judging by their background it was clear that atleast 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates. Twoare believed to be independents.The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seatsin 16 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranianssaid they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservativecouncil that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates hadrejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, wantto make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installingan assembly that is more balanced in its composition.They also favor greater social, political and media freedom thanallowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supremeleader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.These theologians, who control most crucial state institutionssuch as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the1979 Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor,Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces wherecounting has been completed.Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, theindependent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the InteriorMinistry. The official media on Friday claimed an ``unprecedented''participation by voters.The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnoutwas noted in Golestan province. Golestan residents, contacted bytelephone, disputed that.``The stations were empty. How those ballots got there, I haveno idea,'' said Parvin, who would only give her first name. She wasreached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.She said she visited several polling stations and found very fewpeople voting. Associated Press reporters who toured pollingstations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council ofResistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of theelectorate voted.``So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics werespeaking of religiously sanctioned rigging,'' the NCRI said in astatement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press inCairo, Egypt. It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and theregime planned to announce a turnout several times the actualfigure.There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters inIran did not openly complain of rigging.&UR; av/sf/vj
