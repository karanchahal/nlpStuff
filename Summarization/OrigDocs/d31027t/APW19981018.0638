TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of pro-democracy demonstratorsrallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scoresof candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by politicalhard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted torun in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of Experts.Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of PresidentMohammad Khatami, a political moderate. Twelve candidates withdrewtheir names in protest against the screening.The move by the 12-member Council of Guardians is seen as partof the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticizethe selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has thepower to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.``There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholarssuitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater thanthe 400 or so candidates who have registered,'' the president said.In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami saidthat greater variety among the candidates would have increasedpublic enthusiasm for the polls.Khatami said the council could be criticized for ``not creatingthe climate and conditions which would have attracted eligibleindividuals to enter the scene.''``We should not prevent people from criticizing the componentsof the system, the institutions, the president, the Council ofGuardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary,''Khatami said.The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria forjudging candidates was the law. Candidates have to take a test onIslamic theology.In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hearHeshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of thecouncilors that vetoed his own candidacy in Friday's polls.``They have created a situation where a section of society willnot be taking part in the elections because qualified candidateshave been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercisingtheir rights,'' Tabarzadi said.
