TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victoryin elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees thecountry's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.The results were expected since most moderates had been droppedfrom the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council thatreviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assemblyof Experts and the moderates only 13.Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation wasunclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ andthree to declared independents, who are believed to be closer tothe moderates.The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use theAssembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supremeleader and broaden social and political freedoms for the averageIranian.In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President HashemiRafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes. Behind him washard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly ofExperts, with 1,240,524 votes.Hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates onlyfive. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were MohammadYazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leadsthe council that vetted the candidates.The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.The official media had reported crowded polling stations and amassive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearlyempty and calls to other parts of the country produced similarreports.Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping ofmost progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated Councilof Guardians. The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants andallowed only 167 to run.Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year'spresidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who haspresented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979Islamic revolution.Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect towin the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus onthe growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah AliKhamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authorityand have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to thepress and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the averagecitizen.
