	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's conservatives won a decisive victory
in elections for a clergy-based assembly that oversees the
country's supreme leader, official results showed Sunday.
	   The results came as no surprise since most moderates had been
dropped from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a
council that reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by
hard-liners.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
