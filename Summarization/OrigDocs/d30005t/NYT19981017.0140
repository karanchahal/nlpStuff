WASHINGTON _ Urged on by the Clinton administration, SaudiArabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader ofthe Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan todeport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of mastermindingthe August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,according to U.S. and Arab officials.Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise-missilestrike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan,Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence, sat down withMullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme Council, andasked him to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over,Arab officials said.The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most ofAfghanistan, refused. Their recalcitrance in the face of Turki'spersonal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of theTaliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, todowngrade its diplomatic ties with the group.American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts topersuade the Taliban to deport bin Laden. ``Achieving the expulsionof bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we areactively pursuing,'' said a State Department official.In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport bin Laden,State Department officials also have spoken to Talibanrepresentatives themselves and have sought the intercession ofPakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of binLaden's family in Saudi Arabia.If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it ispossible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in theUnited States. If he were to be handed over to the Saudis andbrought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could faceswift execution.Administration officials say they want him to face trial in theUnited States. They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Talibanonly to deport bin Laden. Senior U.S. officials said they were notnegotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating the message thatthey should get rid of bin Laden.``We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those whohave influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view binLaden should be expelled and brought to justice,'' a White Housespokesman said. ``We will certainly continue our multi-prongedstrategy of combating bin Laden's network.''Clinton administration officials said the new diplomatic effortdid not preclude further military action against bin Laden and histerrorist network. Officials said the Aug. 20 cruise missile attackwas intended to break up the network and perhaps kill bin Laden.Since then, the FBI and other law-enforcement and intelligenceagencies say they are continuing to work with other nations toarrest as many of bin Laden's operatives as possible. Bin Ladenalready faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealedindictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the binLaden network, officials say. ``Our tactics may have changed, butour strategy of putting him out of action remains the same,'' saida senior American official. ``This is another way of trying to dealwith the problem.''But critics outside of government say it also suggestsambivalence among administration officials over how best to dealwith the radical Islamic group that now controls most ofAfghanistan.``There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan andthe level of our attention to the need for a strategy,'' saidZalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at Rand Corp. ``A rogue statecould emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now, orlater.''The Saudi role in trying to extricate bin Laden from Afghanistanhas been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics and thelongstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban. But theSaudi request to the Taliban for bin Laden represents a significantshift.Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not wantbin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could be amartyr figure to Saudi dissidents. More broadly, U.S. officials saythey have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to cooperate fullyon terrorism investigations in the past, especially in the case ofthe 1996 bombing of the American military barracks at Khobar Towersin Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.But now, what administration officials say is the clear evidenceof his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as agrowing belief among Saudi officials that bin Laden poses a threatto their government, seems to have prompted a change in theirstrategy.And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimesin Saudi Arabia, Arab and U.S officials now say they have evidencelinking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military facility inRiyadh in which American servicemen were killed.Bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994,would face ``swift'' action if he were brought back to SaudiArabia, said one Arab official.Now, even bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating withthe United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to heel, theArab official said. The bin Laden family made a fortune in theconstruction industry. ``U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia blessedit, have talked to members of the bin Laden family,'' the Arabofficial said.After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would considerturning over bin Laden if they were presented with evidence againsthim, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that Prince Turkipresented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement interrorism, but it made no difference. Evidence was also presentedby Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the United Nations,when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.But Clinton administration officials, fearing that his return toSaudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi regime, stressthey do not want the Saudis to have bin Laden brought back to theircountry. And they note that the United States does not have anextradition treaty with Saudi Arabia. The Clinton administration isstill determined to have bin Laden put on trial in the UnitedStates, they said.``We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Ladenbeing brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossedthat bridge yet,'' one administration official said. ``But SaudiArabia would not be the place where we would want him to go.''Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to theUnited Nations, confirmed in an interview that his government'sdiscussions with Turki over bin Laden had been ``disappointing,''but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to oust its ``guest''would not damage long-term relations between Afghanistan and SaudiArabia. He added that his government would be willing to try binLaden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if there was ``solid''evidence against him.
