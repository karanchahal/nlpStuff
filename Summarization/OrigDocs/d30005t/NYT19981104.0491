NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama binLaden with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa inAugust and with committing acts of terrorism against Americansabroad.Government officials immediately announced that they wereoffering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading tothe arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man chargedWednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chiefmilitary commander.Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under theprotection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement thatrules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown.Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June,that included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.That indictment was returned before the embassy bombings and wasthe result of a two-year investigation into his activities inSomalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he hadconnections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn.The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accusedbin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to thepresent, in which he was said to be working in concert withgovernments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terroristgroups, to build weapons and attack American militaryinstallations.But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's allegedinvolvement in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, forexample, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Ladengave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks.Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictmentwas kept secret for months, but the secret charges were returnedabout the time that American officials were plotting a possibleraid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's verycommon to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehendthose who are indicted.''Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden'soperations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraqto cooperate in the development of weapons in return for binLaden's agreeing not to work against that country.No details were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraqled to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group,which is called Al Qaeda.The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had usedprivate relief groups ``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for AlQaeda. The groups were not identified.Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internalinvestigations of its members and their associates, trying todetect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those whohad been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of theorganization.''The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of binLaden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one suchinformant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden,transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for histraining camps and assisting in running his finances.While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that thegovernment had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in themonths before the embassy attacks, the new charges are anindication of how quickly the government has worked to solve theembassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting andcarrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism andmurder.''Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attacksand the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense,all of the citizens of the world are also victims whenever andwherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorismstrike.''The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms. White andLewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whoseagents have fanned out around the world to look into the embassyattacks.``Our investigative strategy is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``Wewill identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right upthe line, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs tothose who paid for them and ordered it done.''
