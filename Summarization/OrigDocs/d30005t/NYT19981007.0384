CAIRO _ The Taliban movement in Afghanistan might considerputting Osama bin Laden on trial for a 1996 bomb attack that killed19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia, a leading Saudi-owned newspaperreported Wednesday.Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant who lives inAfghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that andother attacks on Americans, including the Aug. 7 bombings of twoU.S. Embassies in Africa. He has been indicted in the UnitedStates, charged with terrorist acts committed before the embassybombings.But efforts to bring bin Laden to justice have been hamstrung bythe fact that the Taliban, which control most of Afghanistan, is amilitant Islamic movement whose leaders who have said they will nothand him over to the United States or to anyone else.The report, in the London-based newspaper Al Hayat, that theTaliban might consider trying bin Laden themselves could not beindependently confirmed. A senior Taliban diplomat reached bytelephone in Pakistan dismissed it as ``baseless.''But Al Hayat is generally a reliable source on matters involvingthe Saudi government, and it reported that the Taliban hadcommunicated the offer to Saudi Arabia as a good-will gesture.If it is true, the report would suggest that the Taliban mightat least be reconsidering their position on bin Laden, which hasdeeply complicated its relations with the West and with SaudiArabia, one of only three countries in the world to recognize themilitant movement as Afghanistan's legitimate government.Saudi Arabia has never charged bin Laden or anyone else in the1996 bombing, and any specific American accusations linking binLaden to that attack have been spelled out only in a sealedindictment. But U.S. officials have said they have learned enoughabout the bombing, of an American military compound in the easternSaudi city of Dhahran, to regard bin Laden as a prime suspect.Saudi Arabia, which stripped bin Laden of his citizenship in1994 because of his militant activities, has turned up pressureagainst Afghanistan in a clear show of protest at the sanctuaryprovided there to him.Last month, it expelled the Afghan charge d'affaires andrecalled its own top envoy from Kabul, the Afghan capital, sayingthat the moves were ``in keeping with national interest.''&QL;
