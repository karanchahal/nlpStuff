NEW YORK _ Several months after the bombing of the World TradeCenter in February 1993, one of the suspects tried to bargain withfederal prosecutors in New York, offering inside information aboutthe bomb plot in exchange for a lighter sentence.The deal never materialized, and the defendant was eventuallyfound guilty and sentenced to life in prison. But the details heoffered in that secret meeting about his Brooklyn-based circle ofArab militants are resonating today in another terrorism case.The accused bomber told prosecutors that he had twice turned toa Texas acquaintance named Wadih el Hage to buy weapons for hisBrooklyn associates. Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges ofbeing part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspectedof the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug.7.It is not clear how federal investigators followed up the tipabout el Hage that they received in 1993. But after the embassybombings, it is evident that they are ascribing new significance toel Hage's contacts with the Brooklyn militants who figured not onlyin the World Trade Center case, but also in the assassination ofRabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and a conspiracy to blow up the UnitedNations and other New York landmarks in 1993.Indeed, the government recently asserted for the first time thatthe roots of bin Laden's organization could be traced, in part, toa sparsely furnished office on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that wascalled Alkifah Refugee Center and had for many years been agathering place for that same fringe group of terrorists.Prosecutors have not said what role, if any, bin Laden issupposed to have played in the activities of Alkifah Center. Norhave they said how the center, which has been closed for about fiveyears, relates to his global campaign to attack Americans overseas.But in the government's version so far, bin Laden's far-flungnetwork is presented as a tapestry of personal relationshipsbetween men of different nationalities and backgrounds who sharehis determination to rid the Islamic world of American influence.In the United States, prosecutors now suggest, suchrelationships evolved from Alkifah Refugee Center.In the mid-1980s the strip of Arab restaurants and Islamicbookstores on Atlantic Avenue, between Third and Fourth streets,was the first port of call for many immigrants from the Middle Eastand North Africa. Notices posted in the shops advertised jobs,rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic-speakingnewcomers.Alkifah Center, in those years, was a neighborhood hub. Itstarted out as a desk in Al Farooq Mosque around 1986 and thenmoved into a small apartment in a building a few doors away at 566Atlantic Ave., above what is now a perfume factory, with justenough room for a desk, a few chairs, a phone and a fax machine.The center's stated purpose was to raise money and recruitfighters to help the U.S.-backed Afghan mujahedeen, who rebelledagainst the Communist government in Afghanistan after an invasionby the Soviet Union in 1979.People in the neighborhood who remember Alkifah Center say itappeared to be a shoestring operation, although court paperssuggest that tens of thousands of dollars flowed through its bankaccounts in its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s.It was this ramshackle office that the government says evolvedinto the American outpost of bin Laden's international terroristorganization.The center was set up by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian immigrant.As his former neighbors recall him, Shalabi was infused with thesame religious fervor for the Afghan cause that galvanized manyyoung Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate a Muslimcountry from Communist domination.One of those who answered the call to fight in Afghanistan wasMahmud Abouhalima, who was active in militant Islamic movements inhis native Egypt before moving to West Germany in 1981 and to NewYork four years later.Abouhalima would later become a well-known figure in New York asone of the men accused in the World Trade Center bombing. Shortlyafter his arrest in that case, he met with government investigatorswithout his lawyer and provided a detailed account of AlkifahRefugee Center and its internecine rivalries.He recounted his brief stint with the mujahedeen in Afghanistanand told of traveling with a Palestinian man he knew as MohammedOdeh to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, the staging area for theAfghan rebels. Abouhalima said they had spent two and a half monthsin separate training camps, learning how to use AK-47 assaultrifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.Later, they joined a militia unit and fought against Sovietforces with the American-financed mujahedeen.For reasons that remain unclear, prosecutors rebuffedAbouhalima's offer of cooperation. But his mention of Odeh isintriguing in light of more recent events.A Palestinian man with a similar name and background, MohammedSaddiq Odeh, has been charged with driving the truck that deliveredthe bomb in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. He haspleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in New York.Federal officials declined to say whether the Odeh charged inthe embassy attack this year is the same Palestinian whose namesurfaced five years ago.nnIn his 1993 statement to investigators, Abouhalima made nomention of bin Laden, although bin Laden is known to have worked inAfghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing officialSaudi aid money for the mujahedeen.Not long after Abouhalima returned to New York in late 1988, theAfghan war began to wind down. The Soviet Union withdrew the lastof its troops in 1989. Two years later, the United States agreed tostop supplying arms to fractious Afghan warlords, and Afghanistandescended into civil war.Many of the Arab men who had gone to fight, including bin Laden,stayed on but turned their religious fury against secular Arabgovernments and, ultimately, the U.S. military presence in thePersian Gulf and in Africa.The turmoil in postwar Afghanistan echoed in Brooklyn, whereShalabi kept Alkifah Center open. With the arrival in Brooklyn in1990 of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who waslater convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks,Abouhalima said, the regulars at Alkifah began to quarrel overmoney, political direction and leadership.It was around that time that Abouhalima said he had first met elHage, a Lebanese-born naturalized American citizen, at an Islamicconference in Oklahoma City.Just how close the two men became is not clear. Abouhalima'slawyer in his World Trade Center trial, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, said,``That case is over, and I know nothing of the government'sinformation or their sources.''But el Hage was familiar with several of the Arab immigrantsassociated with Alkifah Center, say prosecutors and the accountthat Abouhalima provided investigators.A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in court lastmonth, for example, that el Hage had a relationship with El SayyidA. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted on federal charges inslaying of Kahane. He did not elaborate.Abouhalima, who told investigators that he had been in charge ofprotecting Sheik Abdel Rahman during the cleric's stay in theUnited States, told investigators that he had gone at least twiceto el Hage to buy guns. Abouhalima said he obtained a 9-millimeterhandgun from el Hage in 1990 for use by the cleric's bodyguards.Abouhalima also told investigators that he later gave el Hage$4,000 to buy handguns and AK-47s to defend his associates from theJewish Defense League in New York, an organization founded byKahane. Abouhalima said el Hage had been unable to obtain theweapons and returned most of the money.The timing of the transaction was not made clear.The government cited the weapons transaction in a court hearinglast month to persuade a federal magistrate to deny bail to elHage. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said el Hage had acknowledgeddealings with Abouhalima.``The defendant has admitted that while in Texas he made effortsto obtain firearms for Mahmud Abouhalima,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Hisclaim is that after purchasing the firearms, Mr. Abouhalima failedto pick them up.''Abouhalima told investigators of other contacts with el Hage. Hesaid that el Hage called him from Texas in early 1991 and saidShalabi wanted him to come to New York to help resolve a conflictwithin Alkifah Center. At the time, Shalabi's leadership was underfire from dissidents within his circle, including Abouhalima.El Hage did come to New York. A short time later, Shalabi wasfound slain in his Brooklyn apartment. No one has been charged, andthe crime remains unsolved.Abouhalima said he and el Hage had met one more time in AlFarooq Mosque on Atlantic Avenue, a few doors from Alkifah Center.The topic of discussion, he said, was Shalabi's troubles and hisrecent killing.Prosecutors say that by 1994, el Hage moved his wife andchildren to Sudan, where neighbors said they knew him as thedirector of Africa Help, a private aid organization. But thegovernment said he was the private secretary to bin Laden, who bythen had relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan.Later that year, the government said, el Hage moved to Kenya,where he shared a house for a time with a man named Haroun Faziland helped bin Laden set up some of his front companies in Africa.Fazil is accused of playing a role in the August embassy bombingsin Africa.The government appears to have been tracking el Hage for atleast a year before the embassy bombings. In September of lastyear, he was pointedly questioned by federal agents investigatingbin Laden's group.El Hage, who moved back to the United States in 1997, haspleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans andof lying to federal agents. In court his lawyer, Bruce McIntyre,denied that his client had any connection to terrorist activities.McIntyre could not be reached for further comment.These days, Arab immigrants still congregate along the littlestrip of shops on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab food and noveltiesare sold alongside Islamic books. A few thousand pray at Al FarooqMosque at the main Friday prayers, but it no longer has areputation as a hotbed of radical Islamic activity.Most of the men who were drawn to Alkifah Center in itsturbulent days have melted quietly back into their communities, saypeople in the neighborhood familiar with the center's history.``In 1994 this mosque finally settled down,'' said AbdulhakimAli Mohamed, the American-born religious scholar who became theimam, or leader, of the mosque three years ago.No one is permitted to misuse the mosque to preach politics orhate, he added. ``If there's anything to say,'' Mohamed said,``I'll say it.''
