ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An Islamic militant group on Thursdaythreatened to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden isarrested, and described Washington's No. 1 enemy as a ``hero'' toMuslims worldwide.Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide wereindicted Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassybombings in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americansoutside the United States. The State Department also announced areward of up to dlrs 5 million for bin Laden's capture.``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden isa hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, a leader ofPakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, orGuardians of the Friends of the Prophet. ``If anything happens tohim, America will be responsible.''Many Sipah-e-Sahaba followers are fighting in neighboringAfghanistan alongside the Taliban army, which rules 90 percent ofAfghanistan and has imposed a strict version of Islamic law inthose areas.Warsi's group is well-armed with everything from machine guns torocket launchers. In Pakistan, it has been blamed in killings ofhundreds of Shiite Muslims, whom the group reviles as non-Muslimsbased on a centuries-old dispute over who was the proper successorto the Prophet Mohammed.Harakat-ul-Ansar, a Pakistan-based organization labeled aterrorist group by the United States, said, however, thatforeigners in Pakistan ``have nothing to fear from us.''Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin Laden, andseveral Harakat followers were killed in the U.S. missile attack onalleged bin Laden terror sites in Afghanistan.``What the United States does is their business,'' said AbdulBassit, a Harakat follower. He added, however, that the UnitedStates should know bin Laden ``is a good Muslim, and all the Muslimworld thinks he is a good Muslim.''The Taliban say bin Laden is a respected guest who will not beextradited. However, they have set up a judicial inquiry to acceptevidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activity and havepromised to prosecute him if the evidence warrants it.Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000people.The United States retaliated Aug. 20, firing Tomahawk cruisemissiles at suspected bin Laden training camps in easternAfghanistan. At least 26 people were killed, but damage to the areawas not considered extensive.The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan evacuated nonessential staff andfamily members prior to the August bombing of Afghanistan, fearingretaliation. While some embassy workers are back, their dependentsand about 30 percent of the staff have not been allowed to return.Embassy officials said no fresh security warnings followedWednesday's indictment. Security measures already in place includecement barricades blocking the road leading to the U.S. Embassy inIslamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the brick-walledcompound.In the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, on the borderwith Afghanistan, the U.S. consulate is surrounded by barbed wireand protected by an armored personnel carrier and dozens of armedpolice.
