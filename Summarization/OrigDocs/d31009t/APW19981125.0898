ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president began trying toconstruct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not neatlyfit: pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and theirmilitary-backed, Western-style opponents struggling to unite.President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders justhours after the corruption-battered coalition of Prime MinisterMesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey'sfourth government to collapse since 1995.Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potentialdifficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement buta fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largestbloc in parliament: the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeksto instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to thehead of parliament's largest party.But Demirel is under heavy pressure from the armed forces andsecular political leaders to keep Virtue on the fringe. Suchrumblings from the military are taken seriously in Turkey, wherethe generals view themselves as guardians of the Westernorientation.The military has already helped push out one Islamic-ledgovernment last year in what's been called a ``soft coup'' _ whichcleared the way for Yilmaz's coalition. And the generals havewarned they could do it again.Many business leaders fear a Virtue-led government could beanother setback to Turkey's attempts to draw closer to the EuropeanUnion.``It's not very likely that Virtue will get a shot forming agovernment,'' said Ilter Turan, a professor of political affairs atBilgi University in Istanbul.Turan speculated there is a ``state of disarray and changingideology'' within Virtue, formed after its predecessor, Welfare,was outlawed by the government for allegedly undermining secularvalues.Turan believes Virtue is in the process of trying to expand itsbase beyond the urban poor and strict Muslims. Some Virtue backersnow attend functions where alcohol is consumed and women in Westerndress are among the party ranks.``They are looking ahead to the next elections,'' said Turan.Virtue officials say they don't want to wait until the nextgeneral elections in April. A senior Virtue official, NevzatYalcintas, insisted the party ``must lead'' the next government.On the other side, the Western-style parties may seek to suspendtheir ceaseless feuds and unite in a coalition until elections. Atruce, however, is not so easy.The most likely alliance, analysts say, could be led by Yilmazand his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller. Buttheir animosity runs deep.Also, both Yilmaz's and Mrs. Ciller's parties have been taintedby a widening corruption scandal that includes allegations of powerabuse and links to organized crime.The weight of the accusations brought down Yilmaz's nearly17-month-old coalition in the confidence vote in parliament, whereopponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin.Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and riggingthe privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for abusinessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links tocriminal gangs.He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until anew government is formed.The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdishrebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum inItaly. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strainedTurkey's relationships with the European Union.Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battlebetween Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy insoutheastern Turkey.(bm-za)
