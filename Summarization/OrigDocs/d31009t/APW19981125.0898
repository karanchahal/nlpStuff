	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president began trying to
construct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not neatly
fit: pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and their
military-backed, Western-style opponents struggling to unite.
	   President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders just
hours after the corruption-battered coalition of Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey's
fourth government to collapse since 1995.
	   Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but
a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
	   One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largest
bloc in parliament: the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks
to instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party.
	   But Demirel is under heavy pressure from the armed forces and
secular political leaders to keep Virtue on the fringe. Such
rumblings from the military are taken seriously in Turkey, where
the generals view themselves as guardians of the Western
orientation.
	   The military has already helped push out one Islamic-led
government last year in what's been called a ``soft coup'' _ which
cleared the way for Yilmaz's coalition. And the generals have
warned they could do it again.
	   Many business leaders fear a Virtue-led government could be
another setback to Turkey's attempts to draw closer to the European
Union.
	   ``It's not very likely that Virtue will get a shot forming a
government,'' said Ilter Turan, a professor of political affairs at
Bilgi University in Istanbul.
	   Turan speculated there is a ``state of disarray and changing
ideology'' within Virtue, formed after its predecessor, Welfare,
was outlawed by the government for allegedly undermining secular
values.
	   Turan believes Virtue is in the process of trying to expand its
base beyond the urban poor and strict Muslims. Some Virtue backers
now attend functions where alcohol is consumed and women in Western
dress are among the party ranks.
	   ``They are looking ahead to the next elections,'' said Turan.
	   Virtue officials say they don't want to wait until the next
general elections in April. A senior Virtue official, Nevzat
Yalcintas, insisted the party ``must lead'' the next government.
	   On the other side, the Western-style parties may seek to suspend
their ceaseless feuds and unite in a coalition until elections. A
truce, however, is not so easy.
	   The most likely alliance, analysts say, could be led by Yilmaz
and his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller. But
their animosity runs deep.
	   Also, both Yilmaz's and Mrs. Ciller's parties have been tainted
by a widening corruption scandal that includes allegations of power
abuse and links to organized crime.
	   The weight of the accusations brought down Yilmaz's nearly
17-month-old coalition in the confidence vote in parliament, where
opponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until a
new government is formed.
	   The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
