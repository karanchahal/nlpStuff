	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday
after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption
scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob
ties.
	   The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his nearly
17-month-old government could push Turkey toward another crisis
between Western-oriented forces and pro-Islamic supporters.
