	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursday
that she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable of
tackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.
	   Newspapers reported that Mrs. Ciller was already in contact with
Virtue in pursuit of a possible alliance. The party denied the
reports.
	   No party has a majority in parliament. Analysts consider Mrs.
Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro-secular
coalition in the political system, deeply divided by political
rivalry.
	   Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choice
of an Islamic-led government or fragile, pro-secular coalitions.
	   Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing aside
Virtue, it would be difficult to put together a government without
Mrs. Ciller's backing.
	   ``We are open to any kind of proposal. We will act
constructively,'' Mrs. Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the
550-seat parliament, told reporters.
	   One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long her
rival.
	   Demirel said it would be four or five days before he completes
consultations with party leaders and designates a premier. Yilmaz,
meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
	   Elections are scheduled for April 18. Yilmaz has urged they be
held earlier.
	   Parliament opened investigations Thursday into the allegations
that toppled Yilmaz _ that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and rigged
the sale of a state bank - and one other into alleged irregularity
in the sale of cellular telephone licenses.
