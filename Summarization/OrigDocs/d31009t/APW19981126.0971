ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic partysaid Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to leadTurkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with themilitary that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-oldgovernment Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secularparties to piece together a new governing coalition.``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave politicalchaos,'' Yilmaz declared.By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should goto the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats inParliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secularmilitary would agree to that.Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, itsconstitution mandates a strictly secular republic.Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader RecaiKutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged withpicking a political leader who can command a governing majority inParliament.``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It'sfine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''Kutan said.Kutan said the next administration should be a caretakergovernment with the support of all parties, which would lead thecountry until the next national elections.Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-ledgovernment out of office last year, after it came to power in acoalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a keycontender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursdaythat she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable oftackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.Newspapers reported that Mrs. Ciller was already in contact withVirtue in pursuit of a possible alliance. The party denied thereports.No party has a majority in parliament. Analysts consider Mrs.Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro-secularcoalition in the political system, deeply divided by politicalrivalry.Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choiceof an Islamic-led government or fragile, pro-secular coalitions.Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing asideVirtue, it would be difficult to put together a government withoutMrs. Ciller's backing.``We are open to any kind of proposal. We will actconstructively,'' Mrs. Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the550-seat parliament, told reporters.One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long herrival.Demirel said it would be four or five days before he completesconsultations with party leaders and designates a premier. Yilmaz,meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.Elections are scheduled for April 18. Yilmaz has urged they beheld earlier.Parliament opened investigations Thursday into the allegationsthat toppled Yilmaz _ that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and riggedthe sale of a state bank - and one other into alleged irregularityin the sale of cellular telephone licenses.(ht-sf-ek)
