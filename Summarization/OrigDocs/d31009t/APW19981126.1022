ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic partysaid Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to leadTurkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with themilitary that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-oldgovernment Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secularparties to piece together a new governing coalition.``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave politicalchaos,'' Yilmaz declared.By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should goto the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats inParliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secularmilitary would agree to that.Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, itsconstitution mandates a strictly secular republic.Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader RecaiKutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged withpicking a political leader who can command a governing majority inParliament.``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It'sfine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''Kutan said.Kutan said the next administration should be a caretakergovernment with the support of all parties, which would lead thecountry until the next national elections.Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-ledgovernment out of office last year, after it came to power in acoalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a keycontender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursdaythat she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable oftackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.Bulent Ecevit, the deputy premier in the outgoing government andleader of a center-left party, declared himself in favor of acoalition between Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller. He also indicated that hewas willing to take part in that alliance.Some reports have suggested a scenario in which Ecevit wouldhead a three-party alliance with Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller as the mostlikely option.Newspapers reported, 11th graf pvs(sf)
