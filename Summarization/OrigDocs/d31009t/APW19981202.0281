ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel plannedto meet with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stokingspeculation that he'd ask the center-left leader to form a newgovernment.Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all-powerfulmilitary and most analysts say he is the is the most viablereplacement for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no-confidencevote last week over a mafia scandal.Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choicebefore leaving Thursday for a one-day trip to Romania.By tradition, the leader of the largest party in parliamentwould get the nod. But the largest party is Islamic Virtue, whichis opposed by the military. Last year, the military ousted Turkey'sfirst Islamic-led government.Ecevit said he didn't want Virtue in the government andreiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining hisDemocratic Left party with Turkey's two center-right parties. Thecoalition would have a large majority in Parliament.He said Wednesday that he opposes joining forces with Virtuebecause of ``our commitment to secularism without concessions.''The veteran politician could act as the glue between Yilmaz andformer premier Tansu Ciller, whose long-standing political rivalryled to a government collapse in 1996. Ecevit is said to haveYilmaz' support, but there are doubts about Mrs. Ciller.General elections are scheduled for April 18.(ht-cph)
