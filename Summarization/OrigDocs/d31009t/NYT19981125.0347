ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The government of Prime Minister MesutYilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competingpressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military,lost a vote of confidence in Parliament and fell Wednesday.The 314-214 vote came after Yilmaz was implicated in acorruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buya state-owned bank. He has denied all charges against him.President Suleyman Demirel was expected to ask Yilmaz to stay onas prime minister until an interim government can be formed to takethe country to an early election in April. But with both Turkey'scenter-right and center-left parties divided by bitter rivalries,there seemed little prospect that a stable government could emergefrom the election.As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate politicalpower here. Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwarkagainst religious fundamentalism. Critics, however, say theirpolitical role restricts the growth of democracy.After two years of spectacular revelations about ties betweencriminals and successive Turkish governments, many Turks havebecome deeply cynical about politics. Some believe that supportingthe Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust with thepolitical establishment. Military commanders, however, may notallow the party to come to power even if it wins the election.Yilmaz had sought to ease military-backed restrictions onIslamic symbols, which he evidently believed were too strict andrisked creating a political backlash. He urged the military to stopinsisting that female university students be forbidden to wear headscarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down. Similarconflicts are likely to afflict the next government.Demirel could name an interim prime minister within a few days.According to press reports, leading candidates include HikmetCetin, the speaker of parliament, and former Prime Minister BulentEcevit.During his term of office, Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey'sinflation rate down from nearly 100 percent annually to about 77percent. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on aneconomic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York,but were canceled Wednesday. Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister whowas to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in thecorruption scandal that brought down the government.Human rights violations continued during Yilmaz's term, butapparently decreased steadily. The human rights organizationAmnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curbabuses.Although Yilmaz was not able to push through major reforms to apolitical system that many Turks believe is encrusted andself-centered, he will be remembered as the prime minister on whosewatch the country's most-wanted fugitive was captured. Thefugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel army that has beenfighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, is incustody in Italy.Although Yilmaz is perceived as pro-Western, Turkey's relationswith Europe deteriorated during his term. After the European Unionrefused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership last year,Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some Europeanleaders. Relations seemed to be improving until the capture ofOcalan last month. When Italian leaders refused to extradite himfor trial in Turkey, Yilmaz and other Turks accused Italy ofembracing terrorism and threatened it with an economic boycott.The Yilmaz government was fragile from the start, depending onthe support of Deniz Baykal, a power broker who controls a factionin Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition. WhenBaykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the government'sfate was sealed.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Baykal acted after a series of charges that cast doubt on thegovernment's integrity. The charges stemmed from a complex scandalthat has been spreading for the last two years. It is centeredaround allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintainedties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders andallowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.The charge that brought down the government Wednesday was basedon testimony from an alleged Turkish crime boss who is being heldin France. He released audiotapes suggesting that Yilmaz and Tanerhelped one of his front men buy a bank from the government.Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressuredPrime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, intoresigning from office. But his government was not able to agree ona strategy to counter rising Islamic influence here. Polls suggestthat if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finishstrongly and perhaps even in first place, as it did in the lastelection in 1996.Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch togetheran electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory bythe Islamic party.Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of hisgovernment's economic successes and its role in the capture ofOcalan. He is also anxious to clear his name.``It will be the people who will very soon make the realjudgment about our government,'' he said after Wednesday's vote.
