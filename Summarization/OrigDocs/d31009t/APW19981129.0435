ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warnedSunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle tokeep Islamists at bay and in the fight abroad for the extraditionof a Kurdish rebel leader.In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand overa Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday underthe weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority togovern alone in the deeply divided parliament.Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey'stwo center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime MinisterMesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in agoverning coalition.``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, assoon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevittold reporters.Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that theIslamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-ledgovernment.The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meetswith President Suleyman Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up toDemirel to name a new premier.Ecevit also said a political vacuum could hamper Turkey'scampaign to get Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan.Ocalan leads the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, orPKK, which has been at war with the Turkish army in the southeastfor 14 years. Italy is refusing to extradite Ocalan because hecould face the death penalty.Ocalan has asked for political asylum, which has enraged Turkey.But Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might insteadexpel the rebel leader, who tried to enter Italy using a falsepassport.``Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness becauseOcalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying outterrorist acts even in Germany,'' D'Alema told Italian statetelevision on Saturday night.Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Nov. 12 afterarriving from Moscow. Turkey and Germany both have warrants out onhim.(ht-cph)
