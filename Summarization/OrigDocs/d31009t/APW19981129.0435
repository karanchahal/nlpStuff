	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warned
Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to
keep Islamists at bay and in the fight abroad for the extradition
of a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over
a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under
the weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority to
govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
	   Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's
two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a
governing coalition.
	   ``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as
soon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevit
told reporters.
	   Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the
Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led
government.
	   The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
	   The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets
with President Suleyman Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up to
Demirel to name a new premier.
	   Ecevit also said a political vacuum could hamper Turkey's
campaign to get Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Ocalan leads the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, which has been at war with the Turkish army in the southeast
for 14 years. Italy is refusing to extradite Ocalan because he
could face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan has asked for political asylum, which has enraged Turkey.
But Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might instead
expel the rebel leader, who tried to enter Italy using a false
passport.
	   ``Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness because
Ocalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying out
terrorist acts even in Germany,'' D'Alema told Italian state
television on Saturday night.
	   Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Nov. 12 after
arriving from Moscow. Turkey and Germany both have warrants out on
him.
