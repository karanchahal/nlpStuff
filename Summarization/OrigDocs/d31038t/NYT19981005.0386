MORONI, Comoros _ The man accused of directing the bomb attackon the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverishedIndian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave hometo enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan andPakistan.A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrownout of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to drawblood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago,at age 15, to continue his education.Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert,he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holywar against the United States. He was transformed into a killer whocould coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.He is still at large after being indicted in the United Statesunder an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya. Asthe object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward onhis head.The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, hisKoran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relativelyliberal Muslim character. Even relatives who admit that he had adarker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundanethings like animosity to television and threats to chase familymembers into the street if he caught them drinking beer.Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassiesin Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case isslowly emerging. They lived in different countries, labored invarious professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and astriking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about whatAmerican prosecutors say were their true activities.Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turnedthe world's eyes on them. But they say he is a true product of theforces that shaped his tropical nation _ poverty, Islam, racism andFrench colonialism. He is one of thousands of young Comorans whohave been forced by the lack of higher education to leave thesestrange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcaniccrater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flitbetween the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night,especially during power blackouts.They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path toholy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering familyback home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinarylegionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played acentral role in the bomb plot.His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder-blockbuilding behind a one-room Islamic school on an alley paved onlywith sharp pumice. They graciously welcomed two journalists intotheir threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago andlived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard-workingcomputer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at atime. His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastfulchild who could ``smurf-dance like Michael Jackson'' and never saidanything about hating America.When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that theydid not know him very well. His siblings did not see him for yearsat a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he hasbeen gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he nevervisited. Each said, ``He has no friends I know of.''According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda,the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudibusinessman. It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb wasassembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.On Aug. 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here. Hevisited relatives and his local mosque.On Aug. 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai. He had a ticket onwardto Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared. His familysays he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drovehim to the airport.Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to aMoroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept.2. The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents withpistols and radio headsets, ``just like Delta Force'' said anuncle.They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, HalimaBadroudine Fazul, 22, and sister-in-law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in forquestioning. They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera,CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, twoKorans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyannewspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's menand some belonging to women and children.The day of the search ended badly. ``The FBI behaved correctly _they were not threatening,'' said Halima Fazul. ``But the Comorangendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though hehad a catheter in him.''They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts,she said. On her way back from the police station that evening, shewas told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleedingulcer, was collapsing. She ran, stumbling in the dark. ``He took myhand and said, `Ah, Halima, you're back,''' and died, she said.When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarmeboth shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man hadheart trouble.No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has beenissued _ some may still be being tested by the FBI _ but threadscan be pieced together from interviews.Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he isnot a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stampsfor forging others.The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing,an investigator said.There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to bekilled to make way for fundamentalist rule.Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he hadbeen trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.nnAsked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: ``Iwas impressed _ but I considered it childish. I thought he wasboasting. I didn't believe him.''Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics ormilitary service with his brother. ``We talk only about familyproblems,'' he said. ``It has never been proved to me that mybrother is an Islamist. He wears jeans and boots.''Fazil was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before hisparents separated. He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle andat 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi TwawilouAbdulfateh. By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and wasgiving religious instructions on the radio.He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in thirdgrade while his older sister was in first. He played soccer and theflute and could do a standing flip. As a teen-ager, he showed offwith kung-fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.He also had moments of rage. He got into a fistfight with ateacher at his French public school, and slammed younger studentsdown in their chairs when they failed at Koran recital.``He sometimes had a strange attitude,'' Fundi Twawilou said.``On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys.When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away. So Omar, hisbrother, would be beaten. But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallahwould return to fight for him.''At age 11, he cut another pupil's ear. Asked to leave, hestudied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher,who remembers him as ``brilliant, respectful to others, deeplyreligious and very calm.''At 14, he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza,one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving forPakistan. Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls andyoung women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contactwith the opposite sex, while male students glower aggressively atvisitors. Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declinedseveral requests for an interview.The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknownin Comoros. The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many menwear ankle-length shirts and Arab-style caps, while almost allwomen wrap scarves around their bodies, legs and heads. But theatmosphere is relaxed _ the scarves often merely adorn Westerndresses and few women hide their faces or hair. Speaking of Fazil,Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said, ``Mr. Fazul learned adifferent culture abroad. It would be impossible for a Comoran whogrew up here to become a terrorist.''The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470per person. Tourists _ mostly divers _ are few, and 80 percent ofthe local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept themeager ones offered by religious colleges in Pakistan, Egypt, Sudanand Libya, where they are recruited by fundamentalists.``There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world,recruited into the foreign legion of Libya and the armies ofIran,'' warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President AbdoulkarimTaki's cabinet.Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, saida tourism official. It says they are safe, living in a hostel.``Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find outthey are in the army. Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan.''Something like that happened to Fazil. ``When he came back fromPakistan,'' a relative said, ``he told his mother he wanted to gointo the army. She told him, `It is up to you.'''After that he became more of a mystery. He was trained,presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya andperhaps in Yemen. He comes home only for short visits, never leavesan address and calls from pay phones.Five years ago, on a brief visit, he went with his father toMoheli Island to meet his uncle for the first time. His cousinsHalima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there. ``We were eating, and notwell dressed, so we were embarrassed,'' Halima Fazul recalled. ``Weran inside to change.'' At the end of the day, he had his fatherask for her hand.Mrs. Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing,relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing. Butwhen she went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off herface and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front ofmale visitors.Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but nowwears trousers and sometimes a suit. When teased about the Westerndress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart andreplied: ``Proving you fear God is not in your clothes. It's inhere.''He now has money, relatives said. He sends some home, and lastyear paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancertreatment. His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what hedoes, except work on computers. ``He goes away at 8 and comes backat 6,'' she said. ``I don't know what he does outside.''She denied having heard of bin Laden before the blast andprotested that her husband did not hate Americans. She also gavehim an alibi, saying that at 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 7, when the bombwent off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get hersick father on a plane home.There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique withinthe Comoros government might shelter terrorists. Critics note thatthe ``hit list'' for local politicians found in Fazil's housecalled for killing President Taki's political opponents, but nothim. And local journalists were surprised to hear that Fazil got tothe airport late but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as ifsomeone had cleared his way.Moussa, the president's top adviser, called the accusationsridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals andseparatists. The government, he said, first heard from the FBI onAug. 29, a week after Fazil's departure.Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Fazil and didnot believe him guilty.``Abdallah knows good from bad,'' he said. ``He knows that forplanting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would gostraight to hell.''
