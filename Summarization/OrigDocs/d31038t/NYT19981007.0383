NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday thatone of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies inKenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden,the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and ``asked him for amission.''The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man,Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously beendescribed, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link binLaden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, isreported in a new 48-page indictment of Al-'Owhali and three othersthat a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday. It showshow prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial casethat bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind theembassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationedabroad in the 1990s.The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to theoffer; he is not charged in the new indictment.The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have anyevidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whetherthey may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry outthe attacks. Bin Ladin has called for attacks on U.S. and otherWestern interests.Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected ofbeing bin Laden's associates, the government also declared moreconcretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backerof terrorism groups worldwide. Its list of terrorist groupsincludes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led bySheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot toblow up landmarks in New York City.The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda,worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others,which ``operated under its umbrella.''The authorities also gave their first account of what theycalled bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies inSudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorismand to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons andchemicals, and the travel of his associates.
