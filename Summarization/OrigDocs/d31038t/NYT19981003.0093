WASHINGTON _ The United States has obtained new evidence to linkthe owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missilestrike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden,the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies inEast Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last week, shows that SalihIdris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, hashad financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, anEgypt-based group responsible for the assassination there ofPresident Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receivesmoney and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into histerror network, the officials added.This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyedIdris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of theU.S. embassies, the officials said.A spokesman for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris hadno ties either to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. Ina statement provided by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idrissaid: ``I have absolutely no relationship with any Islamicterrorist organization anywhere in the world. I have never met Mr.bin Laden, I have never spoken with him, I have never had anyfinancial or business relationship with him, nor knowingly withanyone acting as his agent.''U.S. officials say they have also received new reports of anincrease in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack.Officials said they were not certain what the Iraqis were now doingin Khartoum. But intelligence agents previously obtained evidencethat the manager of the Shifa plant made frequent trips to Iraq,where he visited the head of the chemical weapons program. Inaddition, a soil sample that the CIA clandestinely took at theShifa plant showed the presence of a chemical used in theproduction of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq.The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack overhis decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department andCIA officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it wasbased on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and binLaden.The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the UnitedStates has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has beenclosed since 1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. Inaddition, more than 100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer inSudan were withdrawn in January 1996 because they proved to befabrications. That year a second informer warned of severalterrorist threats, including one against Anthony Lake, then thenational security adviser, but his reports proved impossible toconfirm.Senior administration officials say that at the time of thecruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement withbin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidencelinking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. Now they say thatthe new evidence against Idris has confirmed their initialsuspicions about Al Shifa.At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack, Clintonadministration officials acknowledge, they did not know that Idrisowned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had begun to scrutinize theplant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's ownership wasirrelevant.``What we knew about the ownership was that a lot of it couldn'tbe reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. intelligenceofficial.Still, after the missile strike, when Idris was publiclyidentified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate hispossible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A Sudaneseexpatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, waspreviously a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank ofSaudi Arabia. He bought the Shifa plant in March.Officials say U.S. intelligence has received reports that Idrislaunders money for international Islamic groups, and that he alsohas a stake in a company in Sudan that is 40 percent owned by theMilitary Industrial Corporation, a government entity that theUnited States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial Corp. inhis effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production,and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gasesagainst U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S.intelligence.But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses with theMilitary Industrial Corp.U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details aboutthe reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of IslamicJihad. But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidatedinto bin Laden's terrorist campaign.
