DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ In a rare public statement about theAugust bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI saidFriday that two vehicles had been used in the attack on the embassyhere.The FBI also indicated that it had learned the identities of newsuspects in the blast here, and that they are at large. They werein a Suzuki Samurai, one of the two vehicles identified Friday,investigators said.Two vehicles were also used in the bombing of the embassy inNairobi, according to indictments that have been handed down. Onecarried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through thestreets of Nairobi to the embassy. Investigators are pursuing thetheory that the modus operandi was the same here.One of the vehicles used in the blast here was an Atlasrefrigeration truck made by Nissan, with a silver-colored cargo boxand white or beige cab, the FBI and the Tanzania CriminalInvestigation Division said at a news conference Friday afternoon.This was the vehicle that investigators now believe carried thebomb, which killed 11 people and wounded at least 86. The driver ofthe vehicle, who has not been identified, died in the attack,according to investigators.The simultaneous blast in Nairobi killed more than 250,including 12 Americans. Three people have been indicted in New Yorkin connection with the attacks, which the Clinton administrationhas charged were masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exilewho lives in Afghanistan.Friday's development should put to rest earlier reports that awater tanker, which regularly delivered water to the embassy here,had carried the bomb, an investigator said.The refrigeration truck followed the water tanker into thecompound, according to a U.S. security official.It is not known how the refrigeration truck, a 1987 Nissan,penetrated the embassy compound here without being adequatelysearched. At Friday's news conference, FBI Agent Ken Maxwell read abrief statement and declined to take any questions. The head ofTanzania's Criminal Investigation Division, Adadi Rajabu, read asimilar statement in Swahili, and also declined to take questions.The second vehicle was a Suzuki Samurai, a small jeep popular inEast Africa. It had been ``utilized by suspects thus faridentified,'' Maxwell said. He did not say how it had been used orwho the suspects were.Tanzania has charged two men in connection with the bombing,Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed.For reasons that are not clear, the Clinton administration hasnot sought to extradite either of these men, even though it hasbrought other suspects back to the United States, where they havebeen indicted. A diplomat here said the United States did notconsider the evidence against Ahmed to be very strong.Since the bombings, the FBI and their counterparts here and inKenya have made few public statements.Friday's news conference was for the purpose of issuing anappeal to the Tanzanian public to come forth with any informationabout the vehicles, an indication that while the investigators feelthey have made ``a significant amount of progress,'' as Maxwellsaid Friday, they are also stymied.
