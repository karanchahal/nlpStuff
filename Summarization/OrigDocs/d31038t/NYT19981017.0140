 
   WASHINGTON _ Urged on by the Clinton administration, Saudi
Arabia's top intelligence official met privately with the leader of
the Taliban in late September to try to persuade Afghanistan to
deport Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected of masterminding
the August bombings of two American embassies in East Africa,
according to U.S. and Arab officials.
 
 
   Just weeks after the United States launched a cruise-missile
strike against bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan,
Prince Turki bin Faisal, chief of Saudi intelligence, sat down with
Mullah Mohammed Omar, leader of the Taliban's Supreme Council, and
asked him to end his protection for bin Laden and hand him over,
Arab officials said.
 
 
   The Taliban, the Islamic movement that controls most of
Afghanistan, refused. Their recalcitrance in the face of Turki's
personal request finally prompted Saudi Arabia, one of the
Taliban's most important financial sponsors and allies, to
downgrade its diplomatic ties with the group.
 
 
   American officials say they are supporting diplomatic efforts to
persuade the Taliban to deport bin Laden. ``Achieving the expulsion
of bin Laden and bringing him to justice is something we are
actively pursuing,'' said a State Department official.
 
 
   In their effort to persuade Afghanistan to deport bin Laden,
State Department officials also have spoken to Taliban
representatives themselves and have sought the intercession of
Pakistan, the only other major ally of Afghanistan in the region.
 
 
   They have also, said an Arab official, talked to members of bin
Laden's family in Saudi Arabia.
 
 
   If Afghanistan does turn over bin Laden to Saudi Arabia, it is
possible that bin Laden might be tried there, rather than in the
United States. If he were to be handed over to the Saudis and
brought back to Saudi Arabia, one Arab official said, he could face
swift execution.
 
 
   Administration officials say they want him to face trial in the
United States. They say they asked the Saudis to urge the Taliban
only to deport bin Laden. Senior U.S. officials said they were not
negotiating with the Taliban, but simply repeating the message that
they should get rid of bin Laden.
 
 
   ``We've certainly urged, in public and private, all those who
have influence with the Taliban, that it is our strong view bin
Laden should be expelled and brought to justice,'' a White House
spokesman said. ``We will certainly continue our multi-pronged
strategy of combating bin Laden's network.''
 
 
   Clinton administration officials said the new diplomatic effort
did not preclude further military action against bin Laden and his
terrorist network. Officials said the Aug. 20 cruise missile attack
was intended to break up the network and perhaps kill bin Laden.
Since then, the FBI and other law-enforcement and intelligence
agencies say they are continuing to work with other nations to
arrest as many of bin Laden's operatives as possible. Bin Laden
already faces criminal charges in the United States under a sealed
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in New York.
 
 
   Pressing the Taliban is part of a broad effort to damage the bin
Laden network, officials say. ``Our tactics may have changed, but
our strategy of putting him out of action remains the same,'' said
a senior American official. ``This is another way of trying to deal
with the problem.''
 
 
   But critics outside of government say it also suggests
ambivalence among administration officials over how best to deal
with the radical Islamic group that now controls most of
Afghanistan.
 
 
   ``There has been a gap between our interests in Afghanistan and
the level of our attention to the need for a strategy,'' said
Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan expert at Rand Corp. ``A rogue state
could emerge there, so we either need to pay attention now, or
later.''
 
 
   The Saudi role in trying to extricate bin Laden from Afghanistan
has been a murky one, complicated by Islamic politics and the
longstanding alliance between the Saudis and the Taliban. But the
Saudi request to the Taliban for bin Laden represents a significant
shift.
 
 
   Previously, the Saudis had made it clear that they did not want
bin Laden brought back to Saudi Arabia, for fear that he could be a
martyr figure to Saudi dissidents. More broadly, U.S. officials say
they have been frustrated by the Saudis' refusal to cooperate fully
on terrorism investigations in the past, especially in the case of
the 1996 bombing of the American military barracks at Khobar Towers
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
 
 
   But now, what administration officials say is the clear evidence
of his involvement in the East African bombings, as well as a
growing belief among Saudi officials that bin Laden poses a threat
to their government, seems to have prompted a change in their
strategy.
 
 
   And, while he is not currently under indictment for any crimes
in Saudi Arabia, Arab and U.S officials now say they have evidence
linking him to the 1995 car bombing of a military facility in
Riyadh in which American servicemen were killed.
 
 
   Bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994,
would face ``swift'' action if he were brought back to Saudi
Arabia, said one Arab official.
 
 
   Now, even bin Laden's wealthy Saudi family is cooperating with
the United States and Saudi Arabia on how to bring him to heel, the
Arab official said. The bin Laden family made a fortune in the
construction industry. ``U.S. officials, after Saudi Arabia blessed
it, have talked to members of the bin Laden family,'' the Arab
official said.
 
 
   After Taliban officials repeatedly said they would consider
turning over bin Laden if they were presented with evidence against
him, Arab officials familiar with the matter say that Prince Turki
presented evidence to the Taliban of bin Laden's involvement in
terrorism, but it made no difference. Evidence was also presented
by Bill Richardson, former chief delegate to the United Nations,
when he visited Afghanistan earlier this year.
 
 
   But Clinton administration officials, fearing that his return to
Saudi Arabia could lead to trouble for the Saudi regime, stress
they do not want the Saudis to have bin Laden brought back to their
country. And they note that the United States does not have an
extradition treaty with Saudi Arabia. The Clinton administration is
still determined to have bin Laden put on trial in the United
States, they said.
 
 
   ``We don't have a policy on whether we would accept bin Laden
being brought to justice in a third country, we haven't crossed
that bridge yet,'' one administration official said. ``But Saudi
Arabia would not be the place where we would want him to go.''
 
 
   Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the Taliban's ambassador designate to the
United Nations, confirmed in an interview that his government's
discussions with Turki over bin Laden had been ``disappointing,''
but argued that Afghanistan's unwillingness to oust its ``guest''
would not damage long-term relations between Afghanistan and Saudi
Arabia. He added that his government would be willing to try bin
Laden in Islamic court in Afghanistan if there was ``solid''
evidence against him.
