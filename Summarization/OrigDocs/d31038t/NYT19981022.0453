 
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Nine months before the attack on the American
Embassy here, U.S. intelligence officials received a detailed
warning that Islamic radicals were plotting to blow up the
building, according to Kenyan and American officials.
 
 
   The warning forecast the Aug. 7 bombing in several particulars,
the officials said. It came from an Egyptian man who American
officials now believe was involved in the simultaneous terrorist
assaults on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
 
 
   The Egyptian, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, is now in jail in
Tanzania, charged by local prosecutors with bombing the embassy
there.
 
 
   Since the bombings, the State Department has maintained that it
received no specific warnings about threats to its embassies in
East Africa. But late on Thursday, a spokesman acknowledged that
the CIA had sent the State Department two reports about Ahmed that
prompted the embassy in Kenya to step up security for several
weeks.
 
 
   When no attack materialized, the embassy's precautions returned
to normal. No further steps were taken to improve the building's
physical security.
 
 
   Disclosure of the warning raises new questions about the State
Department's protection of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
which did not meet the department's own minimum standards for
security. Until now, department officials have insisted that the
embassies faced only a minimal threat from terrorists.
 
 
   In the days after the bombings, the administration acknowledged
that it had spurned requests from the American ambassador in Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, to move the entire embassy to a safer location.
The State Department would not say whether her cables mentioned
Ahmed's warning.
 
 
   According to American officials, Ahmed walked into the Nairobi
embassy last November and told American intelligence officials that
he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck
inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
 
 
   In a separate interrogation by Kenyan intelligence officials,
which was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed said he had already taken
surveillance photos of the embassy for the attack, which was to
involve several vehicles and stun grenades, Kenyan officials said.
 
 
   Analysts at the CIA were unable to link Ahmed to any terrorist
group but they nonetheless sent two reports last November about his
statements to various government agencies.
 
 
   The reports, American officials said, included several caveats.
The CIA said that a foreign intelligence service that cooperates
with the agency believed that Ahmed was a fabricator of
information. In the reports, CIA analysts said that they could not
rule out the possibility that Ahmed's threats were serious. But
they said that the threats might also be a sophisticated ploy by
terrorists to observe and then counter the defenses the embassy
would take against a possible attack.
 
 
   After Ahmed appeared at the embassy, American officials alerted
their Kenyan counterpars, who questioned the Egytian and then
deported him. Soon after, Ahmed made his way to Tanzania where,
American officials now believe, he participated in the Aug. 7
bombing of the embassy that left 11 people dead.
 
 
   The embassy attack in Kenya unfolded that same day much as Ahmed
had said it would: A team of terrorists using two vehicles
attempted to drive an explosives-packed truck into the parking
garage. One of the attackers tossed stun grenades to frighten off
the locally hired security guards. When an exiting car blocked
their access to the garage, the attackers set off the bomb.
 
 
   A Clinton administration official acknowledged that the embassy
in Kenya had received a specific warning about an attack. ``It is
embarrassing,'' this official said, quickly adding: ``It is
tragic.'' Asked why the embassy took few steps to improve its
security after the warning, he said: ``That's the 64-million-dollar
question.''
 
 
   Other officials defended the government's handling of the case,
noting that American intelligence is deluged with warnings about
terrorist plots, most of which prove groundless.
 
 
   Thus far, Tanzanian authorities have not allowed Ahmed to be
interviewed, and it was unclear what motivated him to alert
authorities about a plot in which he appears to have played a role.
He told the Kenyans that in the past he had provided authorities
with information about Islamic radicals because he wanted to see
them arrested and rehabilitated rather than caught committing a
crime for which they would be executed.
 
 
   Ahmed has said he is innocent of the charges and his lawyer,
Abdul Mwengela, said his client's information about the bombings
stemmed solely from a conversation he had overheard the previous
year in a Nairobi hotel.
 
 
   A Tanzanian court refused to release Ahmed on bail this week and
ruled that FBI agents would be permitted to interrogate him.
 
 
   Tanzanian investigators suspect he was a central figure in the
plot. They are now examining whether Ahmed drove one of the
vehicles used in the Dar es Salaam bombing and whether the 400
pounds of explosives used in both blasts came into Tanzania in a
shipment of rice imported by one of his companies.
 
 
   The Clinton administration has not sought to extradite Ahmed
from Tanzania event though federal law permits the United States to
bring charges against anyone who attempts or conspires to murder
Americans anywhere in the world.
 
 
   American prosecutors have already brought to the United States
several other people accused of complicity in the bombings or of
having ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who American
investigators have identified as the mastermind of the attacks.
 
 
   The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam declined to answer any
questions about Ahmed and why Washington was not seeking his
extradition. American diplomats in Tanzania, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, suggested the prosecution was being left to
the Tanzanians because there were no American victims. A White
House spokesman said the case was appropriately handled and that
the United States had no plans to extradite Mustafa because the
Tanzanians had expressed interest in trying him.
 
 
   Several non-American diplomats in the region speculated that the
United States is allowing the Tanzanians to try Ahmed because they
fear his trial in America might bring to light his dealings with
American authorities and other Western intelligence services.
