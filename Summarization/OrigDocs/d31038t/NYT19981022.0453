NAIROBI, Kenya _ Nine months before the attack on the AmericanEmbassy here, U.S. intelligence officials received a detailedwarning that Islamic radicals were plotting to blow up thebuilding, according to Kenyan and American officials.The warning forecast the Aug. 7 bombing in several particulars,the officials said. It came from an Egyptian man who Americanofficials now believe was involved in the simultaneous terroristassaults on the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.The Egyptian, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, is now in jail inTanzania, charged by local prosecutors with bombing the embassythere.Since the bombings, the State Department has maintained that itreceived no specific warnings about threats to its embassies inEast Africa. But late on Thursday, a spokesman acknowledged thatthe CIA had sent the State Department two reports about Ahmed thatprompted the embassy in Kenya to step up security for severalweeks.When no attack materialized, the embassy's precautions returnedto normal. No further steps were taken to improve the building'sphysical security.Disclosure of the warning raises new questions about the StateDepartment's protection of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,which did not meet the department's own minimum standards forsecurity. Until now, department officials have insisted that theembassies faced only a minimal threat from terrorists.In the days after the bombings, the administration acknowledgedthat it had spurned requests from the American ambassador in Kenya,Prudence Bushnell, to move the entire embassy to a safer location.The State Department would not say whether her cables mentionedAhmed's warning.According to American officials, Ahmed walked into the Nairobiembassy last November and told American intelligence officials thathe knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truckinside the diplomats' underground parking garage.In a separate interrogation by Kenyan intelligence officials,which was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed said he had already takensurveillance photos of the embassy for the attack, which was toinvolve several vehicles and stun grenades, Kenyan officials said.Analysts at the CIA were unable to link Ahmed to any terroristgroup but they nonetheless sent two reports last November about hisstatements to various government agencies.The reports, American officials said, included several caveats.The CIA said that a foreign intelligence service that cooperateswith the agency believed that Ahmed was a fabricator ofinformation. In the reports, CIA analysts said that they could notrule out the possibility that Ahmed's threats were serious. Butthey said that the threats might also be a sophisticated ploy byterrorists to observe and then counter the defenses the embassywould take against a possible attack.After Ahmed appeared at the embassy, American officials alertedtheir Kenyan counterpars, who questioned the Egytian and thendeported him. Soon after, Ahmed made his way to Tanzania where,American officials now believe, he participated in the Aug. 7bombing of the embassy that left 11 people dead.The embassy attack in Kenya unfolded that same day much as Ahmedhad said it would: A team of terrorists using two vehiclesattempted to drive an explosives-packed truck into the parkinggarage. One of the attackers tossed stun grenades to frighten offthe locally hired security guards. When an exiting car blockedtheir access to the garage, the attackers set off the bomb.A Clinton administration official acknowledged that the embassyin Kenya had received a specific warning about an attack. ``It isembarrassing,'' this official said, quickly adding: ``It istragic.'' Asked why the embassy took few steps to improve itssecurity after the warning, he said: ``That's the 64-million-dollarquestion.''Other officials defended the government's handling of the case,noting that American intelligence is deluged with warnings aboutterrorist plots, most of which prove groundless.Thus far, Tanzanian authorities have not allowed Ahmed to beinterviewed, and it was unclear what motivated him to alertauthorities about a plot in which he appears to have played a role.He told the Kenyans that in the past he had provided authoritieswith information about Islamic radicals because he wanted to seethem arrested and rehabilitated rather than caught committing acrime for which they would be executed.Ahmed has said he is innocent of the charges and his lawyer,Abdul Mwengela, said his client's information about the bombingsstemmed solely from a conversation he had overheard the previousyear in a Nairobi hotel.A Tanzanian court refused to release Ahmed on bail this week andruled that FBI agents would be permitted to interrogate him.Tanzanian investigators suspect he was a central figure in theplot. They are now examining whether Ahmed drove one of thevehicles used in the Dar es Salaam bombing and whether the 400pounds of explosives used in both blasts came into Tanzania in ashipment of rice imported by one of his companies.The Clinton administration has not sought to extradite Ahmedfrom Tanzania event though federal law permits the United States tobring charges against anyone who attempts or conspires to murderAmericans anywhere in the world.American prosecutors have already brought to the United Statesseveral other people accused of complicity in the bombings or ofhaving ties to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who Americaninvestigators have identified as the mastermind of the attacks.The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam declined to answer anyquestions about Ahmed and why Washington was not seeking hisextradition. American diplomats in Tanzania, speaking on thecondition of anonymity, suggested the prosecution was being left tothe Tanzanians because there were no American victims. A WhiteHouse spokesman said the case was appropriately handled and thatthe United States had no plans to extradite Mustafa because theTanzanians had expressed interest in trying him.Several non-American diplomats in the region speculated that theUnited States is allowing the Tanzanians to try Ahmed because theyfear his trial in America might bring to light his dealings withAmerican authorities and other Western intelligence services.
