 
   MORONI, Comoros _ The man accused of directing the bomb attack
on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished
Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave home
to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and
Pakistan.
 
 
   A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown
out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw
blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago,
at age 15, to continue his education.
 
 
   Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert,
he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy
war against the United States. He was transformed into a killer who
could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
 
 
   He is still at large after being indicted in the United States
under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya. As
the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on
his head.
 
 
   The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his
Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively
liberal Muslim character. Even relatives who admit that he had a
darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane
things like animosity to television and threats to chase family
members into the street if he caught them drinking beer.
 
 
   Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case is
slowly emerging. They lived in different countries, labored in
various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a
striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what
American prosecutors say were their true activities.
 
 
   Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turned
the world's eyes on them. But they say he is a true product of the
forces that shaped his tropical nation _ poverty, Islam, racism and
French colonialism. He is one of thousands of young Comorans who
have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these
strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic
crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit
between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night,
especially during power blackouts.
 
 
   They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to
holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family
back home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
 
 
   The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinary
legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a
central role in the bomb plot.
 
 
   His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder-block
building behind a one-room Islamic school on an alley paved only
with sharp pumice. They graciously welcomed two journalists into
their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
 
 
   His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and
lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard-working
computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a
time. His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful
child who could ``smurf-dance like Michael Jackson'' and never said
anything about hating America.
 
 
   When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they
did not know him very well. His siblings did not see him for years
at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has
been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never
visited. Each said, ``He has no friends I know of.''
 
 
   According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda,
the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi
businessman. It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb was
assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
 
 
   On Aug. 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here. He
visited relatives and his local mosque.
 
 
   On Aug. 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai. He had a ticket onward
to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared. His family
says he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drove
him to the airport.
 
 
   Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a
Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept.
2. The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents with
pistols and radio headsets, ``just like Delta Force'' said an
uncle.
 
 
   They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima
Badroudine Fazul, 22, and sister-in-law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in for
questioning. They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera,
CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two
Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan
newspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's men
and some belonging to women and children.
 
 
   The day of the search ended badly. ``The FBI behaved correctly _
they were not threatening,'' said Halima Fazul. ``But the Comoran
gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he
had a catheter in him.''
 
 
   They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts,
she said. On her way back from the police station that evening, she
was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding
ulcer, was collapsing. She ran, stumbling in the dark. ``He took my
hand and said, `Ah, Halima, you're back,''' and died, she said.
 
 
   When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme
both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had
heart trouble.
 
 
   No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has been
issued _ some may still be being tested by the FBI _ but threads
can be pieced together from interviews.
 
 
   Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he is
not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps
for forging others.
 
 
   The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing,
an investigator said.
 
 
   There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be
killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
 
 
   Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was
19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had
been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.
 
 
 
 
   Asked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: ``I
was impressed _ but I considered it childish. I thought he was
boasting. I didn't believe him.''
 
 
   Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics or
military service with his brother. ``We talk only about family
problems,'' he said. ``It has never been proved to me that my
brother is an Islamist. He wears jeans and boots.''
 
 
   Fazil was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before his
parents separated. He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle and
at 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi Twawilou
Abdulfateh. By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and was
giving religious instructions on the radio.
 
 
   He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in third
grade while his older sister was in first. He played soccer and the
flute and could do a standing flip. As a teen-ager, he showed off
with kung-fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.
 
 
   He also had moments of rage. He got into a fistfight with a
teacher at his French public school, and slammed younger students
down in their chairs when they failed at Koran recital.
 
 
   ``He sometimes had a strange attitude,'' Fundi Twawilou said.
``On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys.
When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away. So Omar, his
brother, would be beaten. But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallah
would return to fight for him.''
 
 
   At age 11, he cut another pupil's ear. Asked to leave, he
studied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher,
who remembers him as ``brilliant, respectful to others, deeply
religious and very calm.''
 
 
   At 14, he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza,
one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving for
Pakistan. Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls and
young women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contact
with the opposite sex, while male students glower aggressively at
visitors. Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declined
several requests for an interview.
 
 
   The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknown
in Comoros. The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many men
wear ankle-length shirts and Arab-style caps, while almost all
women wrap scarves around their bodies, legs and heads. But the
atmosphere is relaxed _ the scarves often merely adorn Western
dresses and few women hide their faces or hair. Speaking of Fazil,
Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said, ``Mr. Fazul learned a
different culture abroad. It would be impossible for a Comoran who
grew up here to become a terrorist.''
 
 
   The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470
per person. Tourists _ mostly divers _ are few, and 80 percent of
the local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.
 
 
   Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept the
meager ones offered by religious colleges in Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan
and Libya, where they are recruited by fundamentalists.
 
 
   ``There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world,
recruited into the foreign legion of Libya and the armies of
Iran,'' warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President Abdoulkarim
Taki's cabinet.
 
 
   Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, said
a tourism official. It says they are safe, living in a hostel.
``Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find out
they are in the army. Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan.''
 
 
   Something like that happened to Fazil. ``When he came back from
Pakistan,'' a relative said, ``he told his mother he wanted to go
into the army. She told him, `It is up to you.'''
 
 
   After that he became more of a mystery. He was trained,
presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya and
perhaps in Yemen. He comes home only for short visits, never leaves
an address and calls from pay phones.
 
 
   Five years ago, on a brief visit, he went with his father to
Moheli Island to meet his uncle for the first time. His cousins
Halima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there. ``We were eating, and not
well dressed, so we were embarrassed,'' Halima Fazul recalled. ``We
ran inside to change.'' At the end of the day, he had his father
ask for her hand.
 
 
   Mrs. Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing,
relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing. But
when she went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off her
face and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front of
male visitors.
 
 
   Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but now
wears trousers and sometimes a suit. When teased about the Western
dress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart and
replied: ``Proving you fear God is not in your clothes. It's in
here.''
 
 
   He now has money, relatives said. He sends some home, and last
year paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancer
treatment. His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what he
does, except work on computers. ``He goes away at 8 and comes back
at 6,'' she said. ``I don't know what he does outside.''
 
 
   She denied having heard of bin Laden before the blast and
protested that her husband did not hate Americans. She also gave
him an alibi, saying that at 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 7, when the bomb
went off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get her
sick father on a plane home.
 
 
   There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique within
the Comoros government might shelter terrorists. Critics note that
the ``hit list'' for local politicians found in Fazil's house
called for killing President Taki's political opponents, but not
him. And local journalists were surprised to hear that Fazil got to
the airport late but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as if
someone had cleared his way.
 
 
   Moussa, the president's top adviser, called the accusations
ridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals and
separatists. The government, he said, first heard from the FBI on
Aug. 29, a week after Fazil's departure.
 
 
   Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Fazil and did
not believe him guilty.
 
 
   ``Abdallah knows good from bad,'' he said. ``He knows that for
planting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would go
straight to hell.''
