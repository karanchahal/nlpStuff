NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Solemn-faced Kenyans whose relatives werekilled in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy collectedbenefits on Friday they said failed to compensate for their losses.``It's not enough, nothing could be enough,'' Beatrice AkothYongo, a widow with four young children and another due inDecember, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree.Attorney-General Amos Wako, representing the government at thegathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret,``This is peanuts for someone who has died.''Yongo was one of 31 relatives paid 100,000 Kenyan shillings(dlrs 1,667) each from donations that have reached 228 millionKenyan shillings (dlrs 3.8 million).They came, some from days away, and wore their Sunday best.Several shed tears as they accepted checks from smiling officialsoffering condolences.In the coming days, more of the 213 Kenyan families who lost arelative will be compensated, said Charles Njonjo, chairman of theNational Disaster Emergency Fund.Many families previously received an immediate payment of 50,000Kenyan shillings (dlrs 833) for burial expenses. Additionalpayments will be made, if money becomes available, Njonjo said.A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killedin the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 7. A twin attack on the U.S. Embassyin neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.Compensation later will be paid to the most seriously injuredamong more than 5,400 people who were hurt in Kenya, mostlypassersby sliced by flying debris, Njonjo said. Amounts have notbeen determined.Nearly two months after the bombings, many people still needphysical and psychological help, and not enough is being provided,aid agencies say.``The needs are very serious and we keep identifying more andmore as the days go by,'' said Amimo Agola of the Bomb ReliefSupport Unit, an umbrella group for all nongovernmental agenciesassisting bomb victims.A total of 17 people remain in hospital for treatment of seriousphysical injuries, including broken limbs and backs andamputations, the National Disaster Operations Center said.Another 200 people need reconstructive surgery, Agola said.Meanwhile, mangled eyelids are failing to protect otherwiseundamaged eyes, hands with severed tendons are turning into uselessclaws.Patients, although unable to work and lacking medical insurance,must now pay for treatment that initially was free.Most rehabilitation programs need money, too, Agola said.For example, 97 people were fully or partially blinded by flyingglass and debris, and need training that the Kenya Society for theBlind can't always afford to provide. Many patients can't afford tobuy the powerful eyeglasses they need.``The greatest need is that many, many of us have beenpsychologically traumatized, and very, very few are receivinghelp,'' Agola said.Businesses have started to fire people who have not yet returnedto work because they are still upset by the bombing, she said.Especially heartbreaking are the pleas from people who saythey've lost the family's only breadwinner.In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extendedfamily _ and the enormous disparity between earnings in the cityand the countryside _ make it common for one urban breadwinner tobe the main source of support for dozens of other family members.The government's social welfare system is hopelessly inadequate,and life insurance is a luxury of the rich.Some people were angry at the paucity of assistance.``This is nothing,'' Esther Dalizu said, waving a compensationcheck. Her dead sister was a senior bank employee who had earnedthe same amount in just a few months. ``The loss cannot becompensated.''Dalizu said she planned to save the money for the education ofher sister's 11-year-old daughter.Yongo, 32, said without her husband's salary the family now mustlive on her earnings of less than half as much. After she pays therent on a government-subsidized apartment, she has just 1,200shillings (dlrs 20) per month to feed her brood, pay utilities andschool fees.``It has been so difficult,'' she said, blotting away a tear.Relatives cannot afford to help her.Yongo is afraid her husband's dream of university educations fortheir children has died with him. ``This makes me even sadder,''she said.(kjd)
