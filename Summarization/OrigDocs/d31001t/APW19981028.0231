CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigatingapartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate thelast apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abusesafter he threatened a court challenge.De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited finalreport of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was duefor release Thursday.The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to afinding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after thefact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a churchgroup and of a labor federation.Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, saidthe commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoiddelaying its release.``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulouslyfair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have beenengaged in a vendetta against him.``But we must and will respect the courts and his rights underthe constitution. We fought hard for those rights and we can beproud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them,'' hesaid in a statement.``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutulater told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appearafter all the hoo-ha has died down.''De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment beforespeaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts.The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation bylaying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around thecountry for more than two years, listening to victims andperpetrators seeking amnesty.The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone forSouth Africa's transformation from white minority rule todemocracy.De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticismprompted by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, theliberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs thecountry, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too wasguilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle.The report will be a broad and detailed summary of SouthAfrica's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-raceelections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moralcondemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individualsbeing named as rights violators than planned, The Star ofJohannesburg reported Wednesday.In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give thema chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out ofthe report, he said.&UR; The report also, 13th graf 13 pvs
