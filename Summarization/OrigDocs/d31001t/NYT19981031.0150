The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1:The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth andReconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the mostcomprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly pastthat any such commission has yet produced.Drawing from the commission's own investigations and thetestimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims,the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era,and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.It has fulfilled its mandate of telling the fullest truthpossible, which is one reason that every political party in SouthAfrica has denounced it.Besides accusing the government of assassinations and bombings,the report criticizes the Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacresand collaboration with security forces, and blames the AfricanNational Congress for the murder of civilians and other crimes. Itsingles out former President P.W. Botha, Chief MangosuthuButhelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, among others,for detailed treatment of their roles in political crimes.One major flaw in the report is the absence of a sectionaccusing F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowingabout several bombings after the fact and keeping silent. It wasexcised because de Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC alsosued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication.The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South Africa'spolitical parties are not interested in an honest look at theirpast, nor in the free flow of information.The controversy has added to widespread complaints that thecommission has not helped the process of reconciliation. This iswrong. True reconciliation _ which occurs when a society is nolonger paralyzed by the past and people can work and live together_ cannot be based on silence. No society can be restored to healthby papering over as much pain as South Africans have suffered. Anoisy and informed debate about complicity in the crimes of theapartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable.The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contributionto the healing process.The hearings themselves, which allowed victims of human rightsviolations to tell their stories in public, helped the country healand opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant truth aboutapartheid.The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminalsto escape justice, is allowing families to know exactly whathappened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that would likelyhave never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system.The process of helping the victims with scholarships and othernecessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. Nocommission can transform a society as twisted as South Africa'swas. But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world hasseen, and South Africa is the better for it.
