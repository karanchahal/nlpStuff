PRETORIA, South Africa _ Following are excerpts from the finalreport issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissionon Thursday:PRIMARY FINDINGOn the basis of the evidence available to it, the primaryfinding of the Commission is that:The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights wascommitted by the former state through its security andlaw-enforcement agencies.Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late1970's to early 1990's became involved in activities of a criminalnature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, undertook,condoned and covered up the commission of unlawful acts, includingthe extrajudicial killing of political opponents and others, insideand outside South Africa.In pursuit of these unlawful activities, the state acted incollusion with certain other political groupings, most notably theInkatha Freedom Party (I.F.P.). . . .Certain members of the State Security Council (the statePresident, Minister of Defense, Minister of Law and Order, andheads of security forces) did foresee that the use of words such as``take out,'' ``wipe out,'' ``eradicate,'' and ``eliminate'' wouldresult in the killing of political opponents. They are thereforeresponsible for deliberate planning which caused gross violationsof human rights.P.W. BOTHADuring the period that he presided as head of state (1978-1989)according to submissions made to and findings made by theCommission, gross violations of human rights and other unlawfulacts were perpetrated on a wide scale by members of the SouthAfrican Defense Force, including:The deliberate unlawful killing and attempted killing of personsopposed to the policies of the Government, within and outside SouthAfrica.The widespread use of torture and other forms of severe illtreatment against such persons.The forcible abduction of such persons where were resident inneighboring countries.Covert logistical and financial assistance to organizationsopposed to the ideology of the A.N.C. and other liberationmovements. . . .INKATHAThe Commission finds that in 1986, the South African DefenseForces (S.A.D.F.) conspired with Inkatha to provide the latter witha covert, offensive paramilitary unit (or ``hit squad'') to bedeployed illegally against persons and organizations perceived tobe opposed to both the South African Government and Inkatha. TheS.A.D.F. provided training, financial and logistical management andbehind the scenes supervision of the trainees, who were trained bythe Special Forces unit of the S.A.D.F. in the Caprivi Strip. TheCommission finds furthermore that the deployment of theparamilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of humanrights, including killing, attempted killing and severe illtreatment. The Commission finds the following people, among others,accountable for such violations: Mr. P. W. Botha, Gen. MagnusMalan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. . . .The A.N.C.While it was A.N.C. policy that the loss of civilian life shouldbe ``avoided,'' there were instances where members of its securityforces perpetrated gross violations of human rights in that thedistinction between military and civilian targets was blurred incertain armed actions, such as the 1983 Church Street bombing ofthe South African Air Force headquarters. . . . In the course ofthe armed struggle, the A.N.C., through its security forces,undertook military operations which, though intended for militaryor security force targets, sometimes went awry for a variety ofreasons, including poor intelligence and reconnaissance. Theconsequences in these cases, such as the Magoo's Bar and DurbanEsplanade bombings, were gross violations of human rights inrespect of the injuries to and loss of lives of civilians.Individuals who defected to the state and became informersand/or members who became state witnesses in political trials . . .were often labeled by the A.N.C. as collaborators and regarded aslegitimate targets to be killed. The commission does not condonethe legitimization of such individuals as military targets andfinds that the extrajudicial killings of such individualsconstituted gross violations of human rights.The commission finds that, in the 1980's in particular, a numberof gross violations were perpetrated not by direct members of theA.N.C. or those operating under its formal command, but bycivilians who saw themselves as A.N.C. supporters. In this regard,the Commission finds that the A.N.C. is morally and politicallyaccountable for creating a climate in which such supportersbelieved their actions to be legitimate and carried out within thebroad parameters of a ``people's war'' as enunciated by the A.N.C.A.N.C. CAMPSThe Commission finds that suspected ``agents'' were routinelysubjected to torture and other forms of severe ill treatment andthat there were cases of such individuals being charged andconvicted by tribunals without proper regard to due process,sentenced to death and executed.WINNIE MADIKIZELA-MANDELAThe Commission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was central tothe establishment and formation of the Mandela United FootballClub, which later developed into a private vigilante unit.It is the Commission's view that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela wasaware of the criminal activity and the disquiet it caused in thecommunity, but chose deliberately not to address the problemsemanating from the football club.The Commission finds that those who opposed Ms.Madikizela-Mandela and the Mandela United Football Club, ordissented from them, were branded as informers and killed. TheCommission finds that Ms. Madikizela-Mandela . . . is accountable,politically and morally for the gross violations of human rightscommitted by the Mandela United Football Club.The Commission finds further that Mrs. Madikizela-Mandelaherself was responsible for committing such gross violations ofhuman rights. . . .BUSINESSBusiness was central to the economy that sustained the SouthAfrican state during the apartheid years. Certain businesses,especially the mining industry, were involved in helping design andimplement apartheid policies. The white agriculture industrybenefited from its privileged access to land.
