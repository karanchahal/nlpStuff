JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Facing a court challenge, the Truthand Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it wouldwithhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report thatimplicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. deKlerk, in illegal acts.De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa'swhite supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prizewith President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to afinding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after thefact'' in the bombings of the headquarters of a church group and ofa labor federation in the 1980s.The chairman of the 17-member panel, Archbishop Desmond Tutu,said that although he took such action with ``great reluctance,''the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge.He said it would take de Klerk's name out of 3,500-page report toavoid delaying its release Thursday.``It upsets me deeply,'' he said in a statement. ``We have beenscrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that wehave been engaged in a vendetta against him.''De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticismprompted by leaks about the report in the last few days.Within hours of the commission decision to withdraw its findingson de Klerk, it was facing the possibility of a new suit _ thistime from the ruling African National Congress.The ANC also wants to block the commission findings about itsconduct during the liberation struggle. A spokesman for the party,Thabo Masebe, said the party would seek an injunction in themorning before the report is officially handed over to Mandela.While the commission's report is expected to lay overwhelmingblame on the former white government for atrocities, it has alsofound the ANC responsible for human-rights violations, includingthe torture and killing of spying suspects, bombings in civilianareas and the killing of political enemies, including members ofthe rival Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The decision on de Klerk seems certain to damage thecommission's credibility. The panel, created as a way of puttingSouth Africa's brutal past to rest without the expense andpolitical divisiveness of trials, has caused controversy from thestart. It has held more than 160 hearings throughout the country,listening to both victims and to perpetrators seeking amnesty.But many whites say the commission is on a witch hunt aiming tohumiliate former government officials and Afrikaners in general. DeKlerk has once before forced the commission officials to court andwon an apology from them for calling him a liar. Some politicalanalysts said Wednesday's events would only further the belief thatthe panel lacks impartiality.``The withdrawal of the findings can't help but be seen as alack of certainty on their side,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, aneconomist and political analyst at the University of Stellenbosch,who has supported the commission. ``Whether we like it or not, thewhole report gets a knock from this.''De Klerk's spokesman, David Steward, said the former president``was very confident'' that he would win when the case goes totrial in March.``He is very happy to be in the courts now rather than dealingwith the Truth Commission,'' Steward said. ``The fact that theyagreed to withdraw creates the definite impression that theyspecifically concocted a case to involve Mr. de Klerk in a negativefinding.''The ANC has accused the commission of trying to ``criminalize''the liberation struggle.``Whatever the efforts to besmirch our struggle by denouncing itas a gross violation of human rights,'' the congress said in astatement. ``The ANC and the millions of people who were part ofthis struggle will always be proud of what they did to insure that,in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they did notthemselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis that themeans justified the end.''There are probably few subjects that get South Africans moreexcited than the issue of the Truth Commission and whether it is aworthy cause or a waste of money. The events of the last few dayshave only added to the debate.For some, like Pal Martins, 34, a former member of the ANC'sarmed wing, the fact all sides of the political spectrum are in anuproar is a good thing. ``The mere fact that everyone iscomplaining means that the Truth Commission has done its work,'' hesaid.But others say that too many questions are being raised aboutthe panel's competence. ``The whole affair is beyond the pale, amockery of justice,'' said Roboy Vonholdt, a 56-year-old sheep andostrich farmer who believes that the commission has been atheatrical act. ``We should all turn our backs on the past and moveforward. We need them and they need us. Let's all make money andlet good economic conditions prevail.''The commission's report is supposed to be a broad and detailedsummary of South Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994,when elections open to all races ended white minority rule. It willparcel out moral condemnations and recommend individualprosecutions.While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging thecommission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legalchallenges had led to fewer individuals being named as rightsviolators than originally planned.Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified that theywould be implicated to give them a chance to respond. Some 15successfully argued themselves out of the report or could not bereached and were therefore deleted from the report, he said. Thecommission is required by law to give advance notification toanyone it intends to implicate in its report.The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerkdid not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know thatformer Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and Police CommissionerJohan van der Merwe had been involved, but failed to report hisknowledge to the police.This could open him up to a criminal prosecution. De Klerk hasnot applied for amnesty in this matter or any other.de Klerk has said that when he learned about the bombings, Vlokand Van der Merwe were already in the process of applying foramnesty, and he did not think it was necessary to report thematter.
