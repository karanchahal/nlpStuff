JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The deal that South Africa's Truthand Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confessyour crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free. If you don'tcome forward, you will be prosecuted.After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-eraatrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page reportnaming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in thegore but never applied for amnesty. So the prosecutions shouldbegin soon, right?Not so fast. The study was barely in the hands of PresidentNelson Mandela before talk of new amnesty deals had begun.It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties _including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officialswho could end up in the dock because of the report. Suddenly, thereis lots of talk about how the country can't withstand a round ofpolitically divisive trials, and many political analysts here arebetting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.Already, three major political parties are calling for some kindof new amnesty, and the ANC isn't closing the door. ANC spokesmanThabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to talk of a generalamnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing anamnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africansagainst other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province withbodies during the late '80s and into the '90s.In choosing a truth commission rather than a Nuremberg-styletrial with which to close out its brutal past, South Africa hopedfor an idealistic reconciliation. People would come clean andreceive true forgiveness. Society would then be able to move on,its wounds cleansed and healed. It was a model watched closelyaround the world by other societies wondering how to disentanglethemselves from the grudges of a brutal past.But given the chance, hundreds of South Africa's perpetratorsdid not come forward. Commission officials themselves say they werefrustrated by the lack of cooperation, however exhaustive theirreport may seem.It is perhaps too late, however, to press for more. Today'sSouth Africa has urgent new problems to deal with _ unemployment,crime, white flight, too few schools and hospitals. So it may windup settling for a more pragmatic reconciliation _ one that givesamnesty to the unrepentant simply because it's more practical forall concerned to move on.In recent years, truth commissions have gained popularity inmany places, notably Chile, Argentina and El Salvador. But SouthAfrica's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty andto subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesomedetails of its past, as sobbing survivors and stone-faced torturerstold of smashed genitals and near suffocations. And thecommission's work added much to the knowledge about what happenedin South Africa between 1960 and 1994. But it will be years beforethe effect of the commission can truly be judged.Has anyone really forgiven anyone else? Will vendettas persist?No one can answer.One thing seems clear, however: Four years after South Africaheld its first non-racial elections, a growing number of SouthAfricans want to be done with the past.Raymond Louw, the publisher of a respected weekly newsletter,Southern Africa Report, says a new amnesty proposal could come upduring the February session of Parliament, in time to remove theissue from next year's election campaigns. ``You simply can't havethis country torn apart by prosecutions,'' he says. ``Everybody isgoing to be howling for an amnesty. They already are.''Even as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the commission's chairman,delivered the report, he seemed to be anticipating a push for a newamnesty and arguing against it. He said such a move would be highlyunfair to those who came forward. He suggested instead that therebe a two-year time limit, after which anyone not indicted would ineffect get amnesty.To be sure, there will be opposition to any proposals to limitprosecutions. More than a dozen human rights and victims advocacygroups have already banded together to condemn such proposals as``unconscionable.''The idea for a Truth Commission emerged as a compromise from thelong negotiations that brought about South Africa's peacefultransition from a white supremacist state to a non-racialdemocracy. During the talks, the white National Party governmentpushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.In the end, only about 250 former police officers came forward,most of them foot soldiers. And only two high National Partyofficials, former Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and PoliceCommissioner Johan van der Merwe, confessed _ to roles in orderingbombings.In its report, the commission called the apartheid state the``primary perpetrator'' of gross human rights violations and heldsuch high ranking former officials as former President P.W. Botha,his former army chief, Georg Meiring, and the former intelligencechief, Niel Barnard, responsible. These men, and others of lowerrank, have not applied for amnestyFor the ANC, the most embarrassing prospect is the possibleprosecution of Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,who is accused in the report of taking part in a number of assaultsand abductions. Lesser-known officials could face charges too. TheANC is held responsible for at least 76 deaths in KwaZulu/Natal.The ANC's problems are further complicated by its efforts tomake peace with the largely Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.Virtually no one from that party came forward to ask for amnesty.Yet the report found that Inkatha, working with the whitegovernment, was responsible for widespread slaughter inKwaZulu/Natal and in the townships around Johannesburg.Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and many key partyofficials stand accused of fomenting a wide range of abuses. Butprosecuting Chief Buthelezi could lead to new warfare in KwaZulu.Part of the reluctance to go forward with prosecutions may bethe result of still another factor: The judicial system is alreadyoverwhelmed with rising crime and the evidence from the apartheidera is old. So why spend the time and the money?At the moment, only one political party is opposed to any formof new amnesty _ the tiny but influential Democratic Party, aliberal group that was not involved in the violence. Its head, TonyLeon, says a new amnesty would only prove that ``the more thuglikeyour behavior, the more you get away with.'' But he concedes thathis is a lonely voice. ``At this point,'' he says, ``there islittle enthusiasm for anything but closing the book on the past.''
