JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The institution exploringapartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the AfricanNational Congress shares blame for human rights violations as itstruggled to overcome white rule.The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commissionculminates more than two years of nationwide hearings. SouthAfrican media released preliminary findings on Monday, three daysbefore its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital.The release of the document is a milestone in South Africa'stransformation from white minority rule to democracy. Thecommission, which has the power to grant amnesty, was tasked withpromoting reconciliation by laying bare the what and why ofapartheid-era atrocities.With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid-1999, acondemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to itselectoral chances and moral standing.There has been no doubt that the report's overwhelming blamewould be laid on white governments and their security forces duringthe years under scrutiny, 1960-1994.Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission woulddeclare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that theANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting alegitimate struggle against the former apartheid state.But in preliminary findings sent to the parties last month, thecommission also said the two movements were ``morally andpolitically accountable'' for gross rights violations, SouthAfrican Press Association and South African Broadcasting Corp.said.The preliminary finding said that despite ANC policy againstkilling civilians, the line between military and civilian targetshad been blurred, SAPA said.It condemned the planting of landmines in rural areas, theexecution of enemy agents, torture and mistreatment of ANC membersin its exile camps and for killing political opponents.It said the party must accept responsibility for the activitiesof ANC Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, NelsonMandela's former wife, and her Mandela United Football Club,accused of killings, torture and kidnappings.The commission also said the PAC was guilty of the deaths ofcivilians in its strategy in 1993 to drive white farmers off theirland so it could be reclaimed by blacks.Justice Minister Dullah Omar, meeting journalists in Pretoria,would not comment on the news reports about condemnation of theANC.``I do expect various responses (to the report). I do not expecteveryone to agree. It will lead to healthy debate,'' he said.He said that if the commissioners recommends prosecutionsagainst anyone for abuses, it will be up to the national directorof prosecutions to decide whether to proceed. The director isappointed by the government.The commission's work is designed ``to help us establish therule of law in South Africa, and to establish the principle ofaccountability,'' Omar said.The ANC already has prepared the ground for a negative finding,saying weeks ago that the commission had warned that harshjudgments were in the offing.The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meetingwith commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoidappearing biased.On Monday, it rejected ``with contempt'' suggestions ANCofficials themselves had leaked the findings. Constand Viljoen,leader of the tiny right-wing Freedom Front, said the ANC had doneso to give the commission credibility by making it moreeven-handed.Publicly, the party has long defended its actions as thosecommitted during a ``just war.''F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president, meanwhile,planned to aska court to prevent the Truth Commission report from implicatinghim in covering up state-sponsored terror.``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omarsaid, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.(djw-aos)
