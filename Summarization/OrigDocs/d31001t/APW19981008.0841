CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Torturers and bombers who carriedout atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling toensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for SouthAfrica's reconciliation body said Thursday.Addressing local and international experts, CharlesVilla-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and ReconciliationCommission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those whocarried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentiallydangerous sector of society.``We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, notjust for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nationas a whole,'' he said.The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, isexamining mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission,which is charged with probing crimes committed by all sides in theanti-apartheid struggle.As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at theend of the month, South Africans are examining its painful andtraumatic exploration of their bloody past.With the power to grant amnesty to many who tortured, bombed ormaimed innocent civilians, the process has at some stage angeredpeople in nearly all walks of life.Many whites see the panel as favoring the black liberationmovements, while many blacks accuse it of being too soft on formerstate officials, especially top ranking ministers.However, Villa-Vicencio appealed for tolerance in dealing withall those who have committed crimes, saying that the potential forwrongdoing existed in everyone.``We all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity forevil,'' he said.Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of policedeath squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail termstotaling more than 200 years after a killing spree that costsdozens of lives. De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes.Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorders,said de Kock typified many killers from all sides in the conflictby his sheer ``banality of evil''.``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary,even likeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinatesdubbed ``Prime Evil.''Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter was gunneddown by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town bar, saidit was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled themto do wrong.Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates she hadattended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers andsupported their successful bid to be freed from long jailsentences.After describing how she hugged the three members of the blacknationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seekcounseling together with their victims, Fourie earned a standingovation from the 50-strong audience.``We must take the initiative in understanding others and startthe process of reconciliation and healing our broken land,'' shesaid, her voice shaking with emotion.(ph/djw)
