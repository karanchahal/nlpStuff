JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A panel probing apartheid-eraabuses has accused the African National Congress of human rightsviolations, including torture and bomb attacks, the statebroadcaster said Monday.The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is inpower, previously has acknowledged it was told to expectimplication in right violations.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its finalreport on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report wasexpected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on whitegovernments and their brutal security services.President Nelson Mandela's office received an advance copy onMonday ahead of the handover ceremony, when retired ArchbishopDesmond Tutu, who chaired the comission, will present Mandela withthe report.South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically andmorally responsible for gross human rights violations during andafter the fall of apartheid.An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news reportreferred to a commission letter sent in advance ``informing us ofits intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rightsviolations.''Commission officials could not immediately be reached forcomment.Justice Minister Dullah Omar told journalists in Pretoria he hadheard the news report, but would not comment.Former President F.W. de Klerk, meanwhile, plans to ask a courtto prevent the Truth Commission report from implicating him incovering up state-sponsored terror.``Obviously we will comply with the ruling of a court,'' Omarsaid, but added he would ``regret'' any court-ordered delay.The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meetingwith commissioners earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoidappearing embarrassed.The party says the accusations against it likely would center onthe planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its militarycamps in Angola and bombings.Omar said he expected the report's conclusions to set off debatebut added it would ``lay the basis for reconciliation.''(djw)
