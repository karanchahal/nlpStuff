JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandelaacknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated humanrights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputypresident over a report that has divided much of South Africa.The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report bythe Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed duringapartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation,the report has caused divisiveness, even among formercomrades-in-arms who fought apartheid.As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime againsthumanity.'' But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rightsviolations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the grouptortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocentcivilians with land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors werekilled in the ANC's camps abroad.Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely beelected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires_ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated allANC members must do the same.&UR; ``No member, 5th graf, 1st Ld-Writethru(aos)
