WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursdayabruptly ordered airlines that fly MD-11s to inspect two cockpitswitches because one model in wide use can give off smoke atcertain settings.But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD-11 beingflown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept. 2, aviation authorities said,because the cockpit switches in that plane had already beenchanged.Since the Swissair crash, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, the FAA hasbeen reviewing trouble reports on the plane and recommendationsfrom the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas; its action Thursday wasto make one of those recommendations mandatory.The switches are dimmer switches for cockpit instruments. ``Thereal safety issue is not fire, it's smoke in the cockpit,'' saidFAA spokesman Les Dorr. He added that Thursday's order was``typical of several hundred'' that are issued each year, and wasnot considered a major safety issue.The FAA said the cost to the industry would be about $60 aplane. The order covers the 65 MD-11s registered in this countrybut not the 109 others around the world _ including Swissair'ssurviving models. The agency said it did not know how many airlineshad already done the work.The FAA issued the order as a final rule, but said it wouldaccept public comment for 45 days.Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of theSwissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all229 people aboard.
