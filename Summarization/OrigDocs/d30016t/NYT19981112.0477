 
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday
abruptly ordered airlines that fly MD-11s to inspect two cockpit
switches because one model in wide use can give off smoke at
certain settings.
 
 
   But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD-11 being
flown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept. 2, aviation authorities said,
because the cockpit switches in that plane had already been
changed.
 
 
   Since the Swissair crash, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, the FAA has
been reviewing trouble reports on the plane and recommendations
from the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas; its action Thursday was
to make one of those recommendations mandatory.
 
 
   The switches are dimmer switches for cockpit instruments. ``The
real safety issue is not fire, it's smoke in the cockpit,'' said
FAA spokesman Les Dorr. He added that Thursday's order was
``typical of several hundred'' that are issued each year, and was
not considered a major safety issue.
 
 
   The FAA said the cost to the industry would be about $60 a
plane. The order covers the 65 MD-11s registered in this country
but not the 109 others around the world _ including Swissair's
surviving models. The agency said it did not know how many airlines
had already done the work.
 
 
   The FAA issued the order as a final rule, but said it would
accept public comment for 45 days.
 
 
   Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the
Swissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all
229 people aboard.
