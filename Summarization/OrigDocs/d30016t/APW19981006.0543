ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking atprocedures for making payments of up to around dlrs 137,000 tofamilies of those killed in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, aspokesman for the airline said Tuesday.The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liabilityunder its general conditions of carriage and are independent of anyresponsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.No date could be given for payments, which would be deductiblefrom a future settlement, he added. Exact entitlements have yet tobe established.All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York toGeneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea offPeggy's Cove. The causes of the crash have not been determined.Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families animmediate dlrs 20,000 payment to cover their expenses. More than130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years haveopted out of a dlrs 75,000 liability cap for people killed orinjured during international flights.The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been servedwith a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former boxing champion JakeLaMotta, who lost his son.The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiringproblems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ a possible cause ofthe accident _ and did little to correct them.&UR; (gm)
