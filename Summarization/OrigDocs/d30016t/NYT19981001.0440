 
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said on
Thursday that it would consider whether airliners can get too old
to fly, which would be a change from its longstanding belief that
jets are eternal if they are inspected often enough.
 
 
   As a first step, the agency said it would expand a program that
focuses on the problems of aging aircraft. That program, which has
been limited to a study of the skeleton and skin of aging aircraft,
was started after an accident in 1988 in which the fuselage of an
Aloha Airlines jetliner peeled apart like a sardine can.
 
 
   On Thursday morning, Rodney Slater, the secretary of
transportation, announced a plan to evaluate nonstructural systems,
including wiring and hydraulic systems.
 
 
   ``Today's U.S. fleet has an average age of nearly 16 years,''
Slater said. ``Ten years from now, a larger and older fleet will
have an average age of 18 to 20 years.''
 
 
   Some planes are much older than 16. Northwest Airlines said
earlier this year that it expects to fly its DC-9's for 42 years.
 
 
   Once a plane has been manufactured, nearly all FAA requirements
are based on aircraft performance, with the agency ordering
inspection or repair after it gets reports from planes in the field
or in the shop that parts have deteriorated. This approach may not
suffice for wiring, though, because some wires are hard to see. And
even if the wires are visually inspected, deterioration is hard to
find, experts say.
 
 
   Wiring in older planes has been under intense scrutiny by the
agency since the explosion of TWA Flight 800, a 25-year-old Boeing
747, off Long Island on July 17, 1996. The crash, which killed 230
people, led to the discovery of wiring problems in various older
planes.
 
 
   Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said the agency would
undertake a five-year study of older aircraft systems, in part to
determine ``whether or not there should be a life expectancy for
some of the wiring.'' In practice, experts say, if airlines had to
replace a lot of wiring on older planes it would be a death
sentence for the planes.
 
 
   One of the few components automatically replaced at a certain
age is the commercial airline pilot; they have to retire at 60.
 
 
   In response to a question, Ms. Garvey said it was not clear
where ``older'' began. Asked about Swissair Flight 111, a
7-year-old MD-11 that crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, she said
she was not clear whether planes that age would be covered by the
new program.
 
 
   Ms. Garvey and other aviation officials confirmed on Thursday
that they were interested in whether mylar insulation used on that
plane may have encouraged the spread of fires in other accidents.
But a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada,
which is in charge of the investigation of the Swissair crash, said
the Mylar insulation recovered from the plane did not show heat
damage.
 
 
   The Washington Post reported on Thursday that investigators were
interested in the insulation blankets, although there is no
evidence that they played a role in the Swissair fire and
subsequent crash, which killed all 229 people aboard.
 
 
   The Boeing Company recommended a year ago that the blankets be
replaced at the next major maintenance overhaul. But Hans Klaus, a
spokesman for Swissair, said that the plane that crashed had not
had a major overhaul since that recommendation was made, and that
it had its last overhaul in August 1997, 13 months before the
crash. Replacement of the blankets has not been required by the FAA
or any other agency, Klaus said, adding that Swissair has not
decided whether to replace the blankets on its other planes.
 
 
   About 15 large airlines that fly MD-11's and other McDonnell
Douglas planes began a two-day meeting on Thursday in Long Beach,
Calif., where the planes were manufactured. They are going over the
approximately 20 outstanding recommendations from the manufacturer
on smoke and fire problems to determine whether any of the work
should be accelerated in response to the Swissair crash, said a
Boeing spokesman, John Dern.
 
 
   In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a spokesman for Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, Jim Harris, said that some of the blankets had been
recovered but that they showed no fire damage. Less than 10 percent
of the plane has been recovered so far, and very little of that was
from the cockpit area, which is what most interests the
investigators, he said.
 
 
   Harris said salvage workers in the Canadian and United States
navies planned to begin raising small pieces of wreckage in larger
batches soon in an effort to recover more before the weather made
such work impossible.
 
 
   Divers have recovered a computer that controls one of the three
engines, he said, and investigators have sent it to Pratt &AMP;
Whitney, in East Hartford, Conn., in the hope that technicians
there can retrieve data from its memory chips.
