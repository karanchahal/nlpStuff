WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration said onThursday that it would consider whether airliners can get too oldto fly, which would be a change from its longstanding belief thatjets are eternal if they are inspected often enough.As a first step, the agency said it would expand a program thatfocuses on the problems of aging aircraft. That program, which hasbeen limited to a study of the skeleton and skin of aging aircraft,was started after an accident in 1988 in which the fuselage of anAloha Airlines jetliner peeled apart like a sardine can.On Thursday morning, Rodney Slater, the secretary oftransportation, announced a plan to evaluate nonstructural systems,including wiring and hydraulic systems.``Today's U.S. fleet has an average age of nearly 16 years,''Slater said. ``Ten years from now, a larger and older fleet willhave an average age of 18 to 20 years.''Some planes are much older than 16. Northwest Airlines saidearlier this year that it expects to fly its DC-9's for 42 years.Once a plane has been manufactured, nearly all FAA requirementsare based on aircraft performance, with the agency orderinginspection or repair after it gets reports from planes in the fieldor in the shop that parts have deteriorated. This approach may notsuffice for wiring, though, because some wires are hard to see. Andeven if the wires are visually inspected, deterioration is hard tofind, experts say.Wiring in older planes has been under intense scrutiny by theagency since the explosion of TWA Flight 800, a 25-year-old Boeing747, off Long Island on July 17, 1996. The crash, which killed 230people, led to the discovery of wiring problems in various olderplanes.Jane Garvey, the administrator of the FAA, said the agency wouldundertake a five-year study of older aircraft systems, in part todetermine ``whether or not there should be a life expectancy forsome of the wiring.'' In practice, experts say, if airlines had toreplace a lot of wiring on older planes it would be a deathsentence for the planes.One of the few components automatically replaced at a certainage is the commercial airline pilot; they have to retire at 60.In response to a question, Ms. Garvey said it was not clearwhere ``older'' began. Asked about Swissair Flight 111, a7-year-old MD-11 that crashed off Nova Scotia on Sept. 2, she saidshe was not clear whether planes that age would be covered by thenew program.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)Ms. Garvey and other aviation officials confirmed on Thursdaythat they were interested in whether mylar insulation used on thatplane may have encouraged the spread of fires in other accidents.But a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada,which is in charge of the investigation of the Swissair crash, saidthe Mylar insulation recovered from the plane did not show heatdamage.The Washington Post reported on Thursday that investigators wereinterested in the insulation blankets, although there is noevidence that they played a role in the Swissair fire andsubsequent crash, which killed all 229 people aboard.The Boeing Company recommended a year ago that the blankets bereplaced at the next major maintenance overhaul. But Hans Klaus, aspokesman for Swissair, said that the plane that crashed had nothad a major overhaul since that recommendation was made, and thatit had its last overhaul in August 1997, 13 months before thecrash. Replacement of the blankets has not been required by the FAAor any other agency, Klaus said, adding that Swissair has notdecided whether to replace the blankets on its other planes.About 15 large airlines that fly MD-11's and other McDonnellDouglas planes began a two-day meeting on Thursday in Long Beach,Calif., where the planes were manufactured. They are going over theapproximately 20 outstanding recommendations from the manufactureron smoke and fire problems to determine whether any of the workshould be accelerated in response to the Swissair crash, said aBoeing spokesman, John Dern.In Halifax, Nova Scotia, a spokesman for Canada's TransportationSafety Board, Jim Harris, said that some of the blankets had beenrecovered but that they showed no fire damage. Less than 10 percentof the plane has been recovered so far, and very little of that wasfrom the cockpit area, which is what most interests theinvestigators, he said.Harris said salvage workers in the Canadian and United Statesnavies planned to begin raising small pieces of wreckage in largerbatches soon in an effort to recover more before the weather madesuch work impossible.Divers have recovered a computer that controls one of the threeengines, he said, and investigators have sent it to Pratt &AMP;Whitney, in East Hartford, Conn., in the hope that techniciansthere can retrieve data from its memory chips.
