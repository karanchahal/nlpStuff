TORONTO (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of pieces of SwissairFlight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now beenretrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept. 2crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation SafetyBoard, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months tocomplete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast thatkilled all 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.``It's a very complicated and complex investigation,'' Bouchardsaid. ``But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safetydeficiencies that may exist.''As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD-11 jethad been recovered. Then a barge equipped with an underwater cranewas brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation wasa success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of thefuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards andbundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into thesource of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before thecrash.Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat,but investigators have yet to establish any details about the causeor extent of a possible fire on board.``We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bitof aircraft to examine,'' Gerden said.He said investigators still don't know at what angle the planehit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines maygive an indication of the plane's speed at impact.The impact was so severe that all the victims' bodies were badlyfragmented, complicating the identification process.Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, joinedinvestigators at a news briefing in Halifax on Tuesday to reportthat remains of 134 people have now been identified, mostly throughmatching with DNA samples provided by relatives.He said 228 distinct DNA patterns have now been detected fromthe remains, indicating remains from all but one of the people onboard has been found.Gerden said the heavy-lifting barge, the Sea Sorceress, hascompleted its work, and will be replaced this week by a boatnormally used to drag up scallops. Its task will be to retrieve thesmaller debris that remains on the ocean floor, about 180 feet (55meters) below the surface.Though the final report is probably more than a year away,Bouchard said the safety board would issue provisionalrecommendations at any point when investigators felt they haddetected a safety hazard,``We will do everything we can to reduce risks associated withflying,'' he said.
