WASHINGTON _ Investigators looking into the crash last month ofSwissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ``heatdamage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system,prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbojets, Swissair officials said Thursday.The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statementthat there was not enough information to determine whether the heatdamage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reportedin the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was ``merelythe byproduct of other events.''One aviation safety official called it ``a circumstantialclue.''The entertainment system installed by Swissair is apparently notused by any other airline, although the Federal AviationAdministration _ which approved the installation for Swissair _said that if it found an airline using the same equipment, it wouldask that the system be turned off.The system is installed on the first-class and business-classseats of Swissair's 15 surviving MD-11s and its three 747s. Itincludes a video screen that unfolds from the armrest like a traytable and can be used by a passenger to watch a variety of moviesor play casino-style games.A spokeswoman for the airline, Jackie Pash, stressed thatinvestigators had not determined what role, if any, the systemplayed in the crash. ``People are going to immediately think thisis a cause of 111, and that has not been determined at all,'' shesaid. ``Swissair is interested in taking any precautionarymeasures, as you can imagine.''About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered, and work iscontinuing to find more of it.From the parts that have been recovered, investigators havefound that much of the heat damage is concentrated in an area abovethe ceiling, over the wall that divides the cockpit from thefirst-class cabin.Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board,said that the forward area, the area that is of the greatestinterest to investigators, is also the most badly shattered,apparently having hit first. The investigators recently identifiedwiring from the entertainment system as being heat-damaged andcoming from that area over the wall.The plane crashed on Sept. 2, on a flight from KennedyInternational Airport in New York to Switzerland, killing all 229people aboard. The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit 16minutes before the crash. Investigators have avoided using the word``fire,'' saying instead that components are heat-damaged.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The system was designed and manufactured by Interactive FlightTechnologies of Phoenix, a company that subsequently got out of thebusiness because it could not make additional sales. A spokeswoman,Marsha Malone, said Thursday that she could not give anyinformation about the system installed on the Swissair planes.Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, said his agency had inspectedone Swissair MD-11, concentrating on the wiring in the forward partof the plane, including the entertainment system, and that Swissairitself had inspected three more that were undergoing maintenance.No safety problems were found on any of the planes, he said. Headded that the inspections were ``in areas that were readilyaccessible, where we didn't have to take anything apart.''He said that the FAA was re-examining the design andinstallation of the system on the Swissair planes, but that theagency had not asked any other airlines to inspect theirentertainment systems.Such systems are a major point of competition among airlinesoffering first-class or business-class service over long routes.They can require large amounts of electric current, and thusgenerate substantial heat. David Sebring, the chief engineer forcabin systems at Boeing Co., said in an interview in August that ona big jet the system can use 30 kilowatts _ enough electricity torun several large suburban houses.
