WASHINGTON _ After the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the airlinegave the grieving familes of the victims all the help customarilyoffered in such disasters. It brought them to Halifax, booked themin hotels and bused them to the crash site. But then it gave themsomething more unusual: space on the airline's web page to speakout.Now, on a new different bulletin board, set up on Yahoo, thefamilies are pouring out their souls about the crash. It is a newway of grieving that has also been used by families of the victimsof other crashes.``This is a bit strange for me; I don't really know what towrite or how to begin,'' said one posting, by a woman named Mette,who said her father died in the Sept. 3 crash that took 229 lives.``I just feel a need to. I want to try all possible ways of dealingwith all the emotions and confusion.''``I am wondering if there are any other people out there aroundmy age (19) who lost someone on the flight and would like tocommunicate with me,'' Mette continued.Two days later, a woman who lost both her parents on the planeresponded.Despite Swissair's offer of space on its web site, relatives ofthe victims said they ultimately decided to move to Yahoo becausethey felt that they needed a more neutral space.Monica Hawkins, whose cousin, Jay Jasan, died on the flight,said the Swissair site ``kind of felt funny,'' partly because theyknew Swissair personnel were reading their postings.Miles Gerety, who lost a brother, Pierce, on the plane, askedhis 13-year-old son to handle the technical aspects of thebulletein board. The boy created a Yahoo club, a combination ofmessage boards, chat rooms, e-mail message lists, member lists, alinks area, calendars and archive information.``You have to have a 13-year-old,'' said Gerety, who is a publicdefender in Connecticut and said he could not have set up thebulletin board on his own.The site has a counter to monitor usage: it recently showed 35members logged in, with a total of 1,019 page views for the day,and three new members who had joined the club.For now, everyone can read their postings. But Gerety and Ms.Hawkins, who are the acting chairman and vice-chair of anorganization of Swissair-disaster families announced early thismonth, said they would create a private bulletin board once theyhad more relatives signed up.The organization can be reached atclubs.yahoo.com/clubs/familiesofswissairflight111. The familyassociation can be reached by mail at P.O. Box B, Redding Ridge,Conn. 06876.Relatives from this crash and previous ones said that some ofthe characteristics that are generally seen as e-mail's weaknessessuddenly become strengths for people trying to cope with a crash,especially the detached nature of the communications.``You can sit down and put your thoughts down,'' said Jane B.Lathem of Alpharetta, Ga., whose son, Ray W. Lathem, died on thecrash of Valujet Flight 592 in May, 1996. ``People find it easierto open up when they're not face-to-face. The site is atflight592.comSome of the Swissair postings show people grapping both withgrief and a new technology.``This is the first time I have written a message at this site,or any other for that matter. I'm really not really sure what towrite, but I feel that I really want to,'' wrote Linda Arnmark,whose father, Per Spanne, was on the flight. ``Maybe writing to youall is a good way to deal with what has happened.''James N. Landrum, of Plano, Texas, whose wife's sister, TerriBell, died on the Valujet flight, said he pays $15 a month for the40 megabytes of disk space it takes to run the site Landrum, acomputer systems engineer, said he is trying to get the transcriptof the National Transportation Safety Board's hearing from a CD-ROMunto the web site, but the CD-ROM stores the transcript as picturesof pages, not text files, and converting it is laborious.Landrum said that message traffic picked up around the secondanniversary of the crash and again when the Swissair plane crashed.
