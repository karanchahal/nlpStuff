 
   WASHINGTON _ After the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the airline
gave the grieving familes of the victims all the help customarily
offered in such disasters. It brought them to Halifax, booked them
in hotels and bused them to the crash site. But then it gave them
something more unusual: space on the airline's web page to speak
out.
 
 
   Now, on a new different bulletin board, set up on Yahoo, the
families are pouring out their souls about the crash. It is a new
way of grieving that has also been used by families of the victims
of other crashes.
 
 
   ``This is a bit strange for me; I don't really know what to
write or how to begin,'' said one posting, by a woman named Mette,
who said her father died in the Sept. 3 crash that took 229 lives.
``I just feel a need to. I want to try all possible ways of dealing
with all the emotions and confusion.''
 
 
   ``I am wondering if there are any other people out there around
my age (19) who lost someone on the flight and would like to
communicate with me,'' Mette continued.
 
 
   Two days later, a woman who lost both her parents on the plane
responded.
 
 
   Despite Swissair's offer of space on its web site, relatives of
the victims said they ultimately decided to move to Yahoo because
they felt that they needed a more neutral space.
 
 
   Monica Hawkins, whose cousin, Jay Jasan, died on the flight,
said the Swissair site ``kind of felt funny,'' partly because they
knew Swissair personnel were reading their postings.
 
 
   Miles Gerety, who lost a brother, Pierce, on the plane, asked
his 13-year-old son to handle the technical aspects of the
bulletein board. The boy created a Yahoo club, a combination of
message boards, chat rooms, e-mail message lists, member lists, a
links area, calendars and archive information.
 
 
   ``You have to have a 13-year-old,'' said Gerety, who is a public
defender in Connecticut and said he could not have set up the
bulletin board on his own.
 
 
   The site has a counter to monitor usage: it recently showed 35
members logged in, with a total of 1,019 page views for the day,
and three new members who had joined the club.
 
 
   For now, everyone can read their postings. But Gerety and Ms.
Hawkins, who are the acting chairman and vice-chair of an
organization of Swissair-disaster families announced early this
month, said they would create a private bulletin board once they
had more relatives signed up.
 
 
   The organization can be reached at
clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/familiesofswissairflight111. The family
association can be reached by mail at P.O. Box B, Redding Ridge,
Conn. 06876.
 
 
   Relatives from this crash and previous ones said that some of
the characteristics that are generally seen as e-mail's weaknesses
suddenly become strengths for people trying to cope with a crash,
especially the detached nature of the communications.
 
 
   ``You can sit down and put your thoughts down,'' said Jane B.
Lathem of Alpharetta, Ga., whose son, Ray W. Lathem, died on the
crash of Valujet Flight 592 in May, 1996. ``People find it easier
to open up when they're not face-to-face. The site is at
flight592.com
 
 
   Some of the Swissair postings show people grapping both with
grief and a new technology.
 
 
   ``This is the first time I have written a message at this site,
or any other for that matter. I'm really not really sure what to
write, but I feel that I really want to,'' wrote Linda Arnmark,
whose father, Per Spanne, was on the flight. ``Maybe writing to you
all is a good way to deal with what has happened.''
 
 
   James N. Landrum, of Plano, Texas, whose wife's sister, Terri
Bell, died on the Valujet flight, said he pays $15 a month for the
40 megabytes of disk space it takes to run the site Landrum, a
computer systems engineer, said he is trying to get the transcript
of the National Transportation Safety Board's hearing from a CD-ROM
unto the web site, but the CD-ROM stores the transcript as pictures
of pages, not text files, and converting it is laborious.
 
 
   Landrum said that message traffic picked up around the second
anniversary of the crash and again when the Swissair plane crashed.
