	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived
Monday in Egypt after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
It was not clear if his plane flew directly from Libya in violation
of a U.N. air embargo on the North African state.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban
that was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for
trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast killed 270 people.
	   Mugabe arrived in Libya Saturday, apparently by plane in
violation of the air embargo.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have ignored the sanctions since the vote.
