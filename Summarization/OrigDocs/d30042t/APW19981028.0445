	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S._British allegations
that it is delaying the hand-over of two men wanted for the blowing
up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim that
it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' the
official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in
Cairo.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Sate Madeline Albright and
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying the
case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did not
hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
	   In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British plan
for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The
plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.
	   The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the
``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which
``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative is
nothing more than a trick.''
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air links
with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil
equipment.
	   The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United
Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of
a trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers from
the parties concerned.
	   The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all
parties on Nov. 9, the statement added.
