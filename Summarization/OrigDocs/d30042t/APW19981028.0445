CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S._British allegationsthat it is delaying the hand-over of two men wanted for the blowingup of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim thatit is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' theofficial Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received inCairo.Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Sate Madeline Albright andBritish Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying thecase and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did nothand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan AmFlight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British planfor the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trialin a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, butcalled for further negotiations and later insisted that, ifconvicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. Theplan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative isnothing more than a trick.''Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it tohand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air linkswith Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oilequipment.The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the UnitedNations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event ofa trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers fromthe parties concerned.The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between allparties on Nov. 9, the statement added.&UR; bm-jbm
