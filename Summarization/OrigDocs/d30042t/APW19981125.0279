CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Newspapers reported Wednesday that three topLibyan officials have been tried and jailed in the Lockerbie case,but Libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a politicalploy by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.An Egyptian source, who like the Libyans spoke on condition ofanonymity, said he heard nothing about any such trials duringmeetings with leading officials on a just-ended trip to the Libyancapital Tripoli.The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi isunder pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two otherLibyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 overLockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths.Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic dailyAl-Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs atthe time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisonedin Libya.The Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammedal-Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prisonearlier this month.Quoting ``well-placed sources,'' the Guardian said the chargefiled against the three was ``dereliction of duty'' but gave nofurther details.Al-Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice MinisterMohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he hadreplied only ``trials are going on all the time.''Both the Guardian and Al-Hayat suggested that the jailing of thethree was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the twoLibyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. SecurityCouncil, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.After refusing for years to turn over the two men for trial inthe United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principlethe proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed inactually turning over the two suspects.The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, AbdelBasset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedlyLibyan intelligence agents.The Libyan dissidents said the jailings were probably a totalinvention leaked by Gadhafi's government.One dissident said the three men had been close associates ofGadhafi for decades and were ``too valuable for Gadhafi to disposeof them.''Al-Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service andKoussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988bombing. The third man, al-Misrati, was a senior official in theRevolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning overthe two suspects stemmed from fear that their testimony woulddirectly implicate his government in the bombing.Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it tohand over the two defendants in the Lockerbie case. The sanctionsinclude a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and apartial ban on the sale of oil equipment.&UR; sn-ggl-jbm
