UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan saidWednesday that he is considering a trip to Libya next week thatcould close a deal to try Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbiebombing.Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume avisit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan'slegal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try thesuspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and usingScottish judges.Because of some positive developments in recent weeks, ``thereis now a good chance that the suspects might finally be brought''to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.There is ``a sense of optimism,'' he said.Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but objected to itscall for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if foundguilty. The Tripoli government has insisted the suspects serve anyprison time in Libya or the Netherlands.It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicatedsome flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said wasLibya's major concern.Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh bythe end of November.``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week andthe question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to gothere and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''he said.Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, areaccused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the NewYork-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in theair and on the ground at Lockerbie.For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the twobe tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to atrial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue toa close.The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspendsanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members alsoagreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce thesuspects.The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed toforce Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.Annan said his discussions on the proposal had been ``veryconstructive.''The U.N. source said Annan wouldn't travel to Libya unless hehad a sense that he could achieve a breakthrough.
