LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects inthe Lockerbie bombing are ''very happy'' to be tried in theNetherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a betterrelationship with the United States.''We can solve this problem very easily,'' he told the BritishBroadcasting Corp. in an interview released Tuesday. ''Then thefamilies of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of thisanxious problem.''''When peace comes between the two countries, they will shakehands and there will be peace. After that such acts willautomatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said.The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel BassetAli al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Amjumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposedsanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over. Heargued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in eitherBritain or the United States.But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Councilapproved a U.S.-British plan in August for a trial of the twoLibyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges followingScottish law.Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi hasdemanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects. He alsowants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya orthe Netherlands. Britain and the United States have refused tonegotiate.Gadhafi did not discuss that obstacle in the BBC interview. Buthe did seek to distance himself from the two men, who the UnitedStates and Britain say are Libyan agents.''They may be guilty or not guilty,'' Gadhafi told the BBC.''That is the job of the court to decide. If they are guilty, it isbecause there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America.''Gadhafi also claimed to have evidence backing up allegations bya former British spy that Britain plotted to kill the Libyanleader.The British government has denied using its foreign intelligenceservice in any part of an assassination attempt, but Gadhafi toldthe BBC, ''Yes, yes, it happened.''''Britain was behind this campaign of assassination. There isevidence and when the time comes we will bring this evidenceforward,'' he said.Last month, an Arab television company broadcast a video of whatit said was a 1996 assassination attempt against Gadhafi by Britishintelligence agents.The footage showed an object flying through the crowd at a rallyand landing at Gadhafi's feet. Gadhafi and his bodyguards lookeddown at the object, and moved calmly away. In some of the images,the object appeared to be a superimposed grenade.David Shayler, the renegade spy who made the claim about theassassination attempt, is currently being held in prison in Paris.He is due in court Wednesday for an extradition hearing. Ifreturned to Britain, Shayler faces the prospect of being chargedunder the Official Secrets Act because of his revelations about theintelligence agency.(mb)
