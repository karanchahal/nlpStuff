	   LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing are ''very happy'' to be tried in the
Netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better
relationship with the United States.
	   ''We can solve this problem very easily,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in an interview released Tuesday. ''Then the
families of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of this
anxious problem.''
	   ''When peace comes between the two countries, they will shake
hands and there will be peace. After that such acts will
automatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am
jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposed
sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over. He
argued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in either
Britain or the United States.
	   But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Council
approved a U.S.-British plan in August for a trial of the two
Libyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges following
Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi has
demanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects. He also
wants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya or
the Netherlands. Britain and the United States have refused to
negotiate.
	   Gadhafi did not discuss that obstacle in the BBC interview. But
he did seek to distance himself from the two men, who the United
States and Britain say are Libyan agents.
	   ''They may be guilty or not guilty,'' Gadhafi told the BBC.
''That is the job of the court to decide. If they are guilty, it is
because there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.
Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America.''
	   Gadhafi also claimed to have evidence backing up allegations by
a former British spy that Britain plotted to kill the Libyan
leader.
	   The British government has denied using its foreign intelligence
service in any part of an assassination attempt, but Gadhafi told
the BBC, ''Yes, yes, it happened.''
	   ''Britain was behind this campaign of assassination. There is
evidence and when the time comes we will bring this evidence
forward,'' he said.
	   Last month, an Arab television company broadcast a video of what
it said was a 1996 assassination attempt against Gadhafi by British
intelligence agents.
	   The footage showed an object flying through the crowd at a rally
and landing at Gadhafi's feet. Gadhafi and his bodyguards looked
down at the object, and moved calmly away. In some of the images,
the object appeared to be a superimposed grenade.
	   David Shayler, the renegade spy who made the claim about the
assassination attempt, is currently being held in prison in Paris.
He is due in court Wednesday for an extradition hearing. If
returned to Britain, Shayler faces the prospect of being charged
under the Official Secrets Act because of his revelations about the
intelligence agency.
