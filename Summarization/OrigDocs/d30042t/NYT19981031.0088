TRIPOLI, Libya _ Outwardly at least, nearly everything ondisplay in Libya these days seems calculated to project defiance.Posters plastered on downtown streets mock six years of U.N.sanctions, hailing as heroes African leaders who have flown toLibya in violation of an international ban on air travel here.The new backdrop for state television broadcasts is now a map ofAfrica, not the Arab world, a slap at Arab neighbors accused ofbeing too timid to join Libya's quest to get the sanctions lifted.A sign affixed to the seaside Grand Hotel captures the spiritexactly, if ungrammatically. ``Hand's Off Libya!'' it declares.And yet behind this stubborn facade there are indications thatthe Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, might at last be close toaccepting a compromise that could bring an end to his country'sisolation, imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wantedin the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish villageof Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed.Although he has sent mixed signals about it, Gadhafi may becarefully weighing a deal, proposed in August by the United Statesand Britain, that would require Libya to surrender the two suspectsfor a trial in the Netherlands.Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years ofrefusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or theUnited States. But it is insisting on certain guarantees, includinga promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in theNetherlands or Libya if convicted.Still, Tripoli-based diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi issincere in wanting to go forward with the arrangement, in partbecause many ordinary Libyans have begun to get fed up with theU.N. penalties.``I'm quite sure that the Libyans want to solve the problem,'' aWestern ambassador here said. ``Perhaps at the beginning theembargo didn't make things too hard for the regime. But over time,I think, it's becoming harder and harder.''The U.N. sanctions ban only international flights to and fromLibya and the sale of arms and certain other restricted goods.Other trade, including oil, moves freely between Libya and othercountries by road and sea.If Libya does not agree to the U.S.-British proposal, theSecurity Council has warned that it will consider tighteningsanctions further, with measures that could include a ban onLibya's sales of oil.But because backing even for the current measures is clearlywithering not only in Africa but in other countries around theworld, it is far from clear that the Security Council could makegood on that threat. That raises the possibility that even withdiscomfort at home, Gadhafi may ultimately conclude that his bestoption is to wait the crisis out.For now, though, one clear indication that Libya is acting inearnest, diplomats say, is the government's dismissal in Septemberof a lawyer, Ibrahim Legwell, who for seven years headed thesuspects' defense team.Legwell had criticized the U.S.-British proposal as inadequate,and in an interview in his offices here, he said that the fact thathe had been replaced reflected a desire for greater flexibility.``It seems that the government doesn't like somebody who says no,''he said.A new team of lawyers, headed by Kamel al-Makhour, traveled toNew York in October to discuss with U.N. legal officials thearrangements for a possible trial. And in their first televisedappearance in four years, the two Libyans accused of carrying outthe bombing told the London-based Arabic-language satellite channelMBC in October that they were ready to stand trial if their safetywas guaranteed.In an interview published on Oct. 18 in the Sunday Times ofLondon, Gadhafi was quoted as saying that he wanted to see an endto confrontation with the West over the Lockerbie case. ``Ourpeople want peace,'' he said. ``They want to be friends.''In another interview, broadcast on Oct. 22 on the BBC, theLibyan leader Gadhafi distanced himself from whoever may havecarried out the 1988 bombing, saying that the bombers may have beentaking ``their own revenge'' against the United States for its 1986air and missile raid on Libya.At issue is the fate of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahiand Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who the United States and Britain havesaid were Libyan intelligence agents. The two were indicted in 1991after an investigation concluded that they had carried out thebombing by planting an explosive in a suitcase.Their former lawyer, Legwell, said that the two men had spentthe last six years ``not in custody exactly'' but without passportsand suspended _ albeit with pay _ from their jobs with Libyan ArabAirways.After Libya refused to extradite the two, Britain and the UnitedStates successfully pushed for the U.N. sanctions, which wereimposed in 1992 and include a ban on arms sales and allinternational flights. But those measures have failed to persuadeGadhafi to hand over the suspects and, in the meantime,international support for the sanctions has withered in somequarters.Gadhafi himself has violated the flight ban on severaloccasions, but the United Nations has responded with little morethan a scolding. And in the last two months, several Africanleaders _ including the heads of state of Niger, Chad, Mali, theCentral African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia and Uganda _ havedefiantly traveled to Libya by plane, acts that were officiallycondoned by the Organization of African Unity.The 22-member Arab League has been less daring, trying to serveas an intermediary in discussions with Britain and the UnitedStates, but choosing at a meeting last month not to flout thesanctions. It was that decision that infuriated Gadhafi, who duringhis 29 years in power has always been an ardent proponent of Arabunity.Within a matter of days, the Libyan leader pronounced that ``theArab world is finished,'' the map of the Arab world was removedfrom state television, and the government announced that it hadeliminated its Ministry of Arab Unity. This week it even advisedthe Arab League that it had decided to downgrade its ``permanent''status at the organization to that of a ``resident delegation.''In interviews here, Arab and Western diplomats acknowledged thatsuch pique underscored an unpredictability that made it impossibleto know whether Gadhafi would ultimately accept the U.S.-Britishplan. But they said they believed that Gadhafi had been genuinelysurprised by the offer, extended on Aug. 24.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnAlthough the plan is essentially the same one Gadhafi himselflong proposed, the Libyan leader initially dismissed it as onebound to be ridden with tricks. It calls for the two suspects to betried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law andpromises that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted as soon as thesuspects are surrendered.The United States has described the offer as non-negotiable. Butthe Libyan leader has raised many questions, including how theappeals would be handled, where the suspects would be imprisoned ifconvicted, and how their rights would be protected.Diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is plainly concernedthat the two men will be used by prosecutors to make a case againstLibya itself, which some in the West believe had a hand in thebombing.Still, they say, any Libyan reluctance to accept the deal isalmost certainly counterbalanced by worries that a refusal mightwell prompt the United Nations to make good on a threat to tightenthe sanctions, which Libyans see as less and less tolerable.One Libyan government official, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity, conceded in an interview that if Libyans were askedtheir frank opinion, the vast majority would say that the suspectsshould be surrendered to bring an end to sanctions.While the sanctions do not bar Libya from selling oil, whichprovides 95 percent of its export earnings, they have made lifeuncomfortable.Sales of arms and certain other goods, including airplane parts,are prohibited, and domestic air service within Libya _ with aterritory larger than Alaska _ has ground nearly to a halt.And since international air travel is also banned, Libyans whowant to travel abroad must begin their journey either by ferry, onan overloaded vessel that makes an overnight crossing from Tripolito the Mediterranean island of Malta, or with an arduous overlandjourney across the border into Egypt or Tunisia.
