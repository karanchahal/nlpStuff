SABRATHA, Libya _ Among majestic Roman ruins set against anazure sea, Sebastian Cuisenier walked alone, a rare visitor to asite that almost anywhere else in the world would be thronged withtourists.``I've always liked pariah countries,'' Cuisenier, 27, aFrenchman from Marseilles, said when asked why he had includedLibya to a two-month journey through the region. ``And I have acertain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism.''As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyanauthorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Cuisenierto take the same step. It was not until three years ago that Libyaeven established a Ministry of Tourism.Under U.N. sanctions, which prohibit international flights, theonly way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry.Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88,000visitors, about one-third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt inan average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that eventhis number may be inflated.But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, hasnevertheless now pronounced tourism to be ``the industry of the21st century.'' And if real and psychological barriers could beremoved, one diplomat said, ``the potential is absolutelystunning.''Scattered along Libya's 1,100-mile Mediterranean coast areGreek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of theregion's richest archaeological treasures.Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was firstinhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and alsoboasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920s by Italian experts.The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes toTripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100,000people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World HeritageSite.The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanestin the Mediterranean. The vast desert includes another WorldHeritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 milessouth of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4,000 years agoby the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population. In WadiMathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be foundthat date from neolithic times.Slowly, government officials say, they are making progress inluring visitors to such sites. A crowd that gathered recently for acultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin.Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious abouta land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing toendure the five-hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, thenearest international airport.Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necksare no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although bothare still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost theirappetite for crowds.``It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places,'' saidFrancois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France. ``What I like most isthat I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I canhave some peace.''Mohammed Gattus, Libya's undersecretary of tourism, said that arecent two-day conference held in Tripoli was intended to helptrain local tour operators in order to put the industry ``on asound foundation.''But as Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles totravel within Libya _ particularly by independent visitors _ remainconsiderable. The official exchange rate is wildly inflated, andthe government has not yet settled on a plan to establish a morerealistic rate for tourists.Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car. Oneeffect of the U.N. sanctions, imposed since 1992 because of Libya'srefusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a PanAm airliner, has been to ground most of the country's domestic airfleet.At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has beenrelatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col. MoammarGadhafi, the Libyan leader, declares their country is a ``state ofthe masses,'' has created what Cuisenier described as ``not exactlya service-oriented economy.''Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and ifthe U.N. sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become bigbusiness. And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful thatanimosity from the West, and particularly from the United States,has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions.``My message is simple: we cannot ignore America,'' Salahel-Fathali, the executive director of the National CancerInstitute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visitingFrench doctors around the Sabratha site. ``But at the same time,you cannot ignore us.''
