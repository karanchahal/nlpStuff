GOTEBORG, Sweden _ They were teen-agers whose parents hadbrought them here from homes torn by war or terror _ from Bosnia,Eritrea, Somalia and others _ and in their new country they formednew bonds, through school and music and parties.About 65 of the young people died and more than 190 wereseriously injured late Thursday night when fire and smoke engulfedan overcrowded makeshift discotheque that had only one unlockeddoor.The fire was the deadliest this country has seen in decades, andit was all the more painful because it highlighted the profounddivide between native Swedes and the rainbow of immigrants who havefound refuge here over the decades.Almost all of the victims were teenagers between the ages of 13and 17, who had packed into a Halloween hip-hop party at a hallowned by a Macedonian civic organization. Most of the victims diedfrom smoke inhalation as they trampled each other in a panickedattempt to escape, but others were scorched by the heat.Firefighters and police said they still had not determined thefire's cause. Though its explosive speed initially ledinvestigators to suspect arson, later Friday they said evidencepointed to electrical short-circuits in the lighting or soundsystems.``We were dancing and then suddenly people were screaming andrunning and pushing,'' said Sara Afeworki, 15, who came here fromEritrea six years ago. ``There were two exits, but the one in theback was covered up. The only way out was a small door at thefront, and there were 400 people.''At candlelight memorials outside the discotheque, and at localhospitals, Kurds found themselves clinging in grief to classmatesfrom Romania, Uganda and many other places that refugees have fledin the last 20 years.Survivors described watching their friends jump from the windowson the building's second floor. Others, who managed to get out thedoor, recalled a horrifying chaos within the building as they foundthemselves choking and clawing their way toward fresh air.``It the most frightening thing I have ever been through,'' saidArya Shafai, a 15-year-old Iranian, as he recuperated in a bed atthe nearby Salgrenska Hospital. Arya said he would probably nothave escaped, except that three larger teen-agers managed to pullhim out from a mass of collapsed bodies around him. The boy whocame to the party with him, Gilsad, never got out. ``He was just sosmall, you know,'' said Arya, his voice trailing off.Survivors and police officials said the hall had been rented outby a group of Kurdish students, who organized a hip-hop party andcharged an entrance fee of about $5. The hall was not supposed tohold more than 150 people; about 400 were inside when the firebroke out shortly before midnight.Many of the dancers, including Arya, said they saw a lampexploding just before the panic began. Others said they had seen aspeaker fall over and appear to be malfunctioning.Disk jockeys quickly began urging people to leave the building,but survivors said the hall was so crowded that the teenagers hadlittle idea at first about what was happening.``Somebody said something about tear gas,'' said AndreaGuajardo, a 15-year-old Chilean girl who had come with her Iranianclassmate, Yusra Morabet. ``We got out of the building and thoughtthings were actually okay. Then we looked up and saw people bangingon the windows of the second floor and then trying to jump out.''When police and rescue workers showed up a few minutes aftermidnight, they found many young people relentlessly holding ontocompanions who had collapsed or even died in the parking lot.``Young people were holding onto dead and dying friends,'' saidSten Schaaf, a police officer who coordinated part of the rescueoperation, which lasted until about 5 a.m. Friday. ``In suchsituations, you just can't tear them apart.''Swedish Prime Minister Goren Persson toured the charred remainsof the discotheque this afternoon and came out visibly shaken.``It was all burned out, with only a skeleton left,'' he toldSwedish reporters. ``On the floor were shoes and boots _ boots justlike our children have. It was only then that you could reallyunderstand what happened.''Birgitta Bahl, speaker of Sweden's Parliament, noted withparticular sadness that the tragedy had befallen people who hadcome to Sweden in the hope of escaping violent death.``It is especially moving that many of the families who losttheir children had come here to seek refuge from violence andsuppression,'' Ms. Bahl said. Swedish officials quickly set uppsychological counseling centers around the city Friday, andchurches in almost every neighborhood held bereavement servicesthis evening.Yet chaos and confusion continued to dominate efforts at pickingup the pieces. Officials said Friday night they had only been ableto positively identify a handful of the dead teen-agers so far,because many of partygoers either had no identification cards orfalse ones with false ages.As a result, many dazed students and parents wandered around thehospitals here fearful that missing friends or children had diedbut unable to know for sure. Police officials said it may beseveral days before they know the names of every victim.
