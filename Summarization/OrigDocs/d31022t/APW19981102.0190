GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ After clinging to life for three days,two youths trapped in a dance-hall fire died early Monday, bringingthe death toll in the inferno to 62.With another 17 people still in intensive care, the figure couldstill go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire disaster ofmodern times.The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among anestimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rentedsecond-floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly beforemidnight Thursday.The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, thelocal association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen-agers whoarranged the dance.The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say itis possible that the arrangers who allowed the hall to be severelyovercrowded could be charged with contributing to others' deaths.``It's important that people have a clear understanding that theauthorities' approval of the premises was not a joke,'' chiefprosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the fire investigation, wasquoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.However, Noren said, a decision on that question would waituntil the cause of the fire has been determined.The fire's ferociously quick spread has prompted widespeculation that it was set. But witnesses have given widelyvarying accounts _ some saying it appeared to start in theequipment used by the disc jockey and others saying there was smokecoming up fom the emergency exit's stairway before the flames racedthrough the hall.The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panickeddancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap outof second-story windows.Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children ofimmigrant parents.
