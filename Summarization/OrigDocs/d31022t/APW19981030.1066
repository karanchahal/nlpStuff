GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into anupstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time thesun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals orweeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of themseverely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain bricktwo-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned aboisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter ofmoments.Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed thepanic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants,exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.Below the second-floor windows lay stray shoes, broken glass andbloody blankets used to wrap those who may or may not have lived.``I've been crying all day. I haven't been able to sleep. I'malive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,''17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruinedbuilding Friday afternoon. She said she had been at the dance andtwo male friends of hers died.Zuhir Hersi, the 17-year-old disc jockey at the bash, told ofhis ordeal in telegraphic bursts. ``Panic. No help. No police. Nofiremen. Only kids helping each other,'' he said from his bed in aGoteborg hospital.Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believesthe police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first firetrucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.But the fire spread so fast that even an instant response wouldlikely have been too slow.The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Fridayevening. Fire Brigade Engineer Bo Wahlstroem said the flames'quick, raging spread could indicate arson, or that the fire hadburned undetected for a time before exploding.The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where thedance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrantassociation in Sweden's second-largest city. The association hadhired out the hall for the night to eight party arrangers, policesaid but declined to identify the arrangers.The crowd was mostly aged 13 to 18, witnesses said, andconsisted mostly of immigrants or children of immigrant parents.Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as wellas people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecifiedLatin American countries.Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcingrelatives and friends exhausted with dread to wait for hours athospitals. Some were able to make the wait in rooms off-limits tojournalists, but many had to wait in corridors, crying andteen-agers hurry in and out of rooms as they looked for their pals.Only 14 bodies had been indentified by Friday evening.``The identification is hard not only because of the burns butalso because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of SahlgrenskaHospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 kilometers(300 miles) west of Stockholm.The blaze, the worst fire disaster in Sweden's modern history,shocked a country renowned for its smooth calmness. King Carl XVIGustaf, on a trip out of the country, sent a statement reassuringvictims' relatives that ``all of us in Sweden feel greatsympathy.''Prime Minister Goeran Persson travelled from Stockholm to thefire site, first laying flowers outside and walking into the guttedwreck.``The floor was full of shoes and boots, the same kind of bootsmy own children wear,'' he said.On Friday evening, about 1,500 mostly young people, came to theGoteborg Cathedral to try to assuage their grief and bewildermentat a memorial service. The youths were dressed in the same sort ofhip-hop garb that the dance-goers had worn, but listened todelicate hymns instead of pounding disco.They wept, they embraced, and some looked around nervously,apparently not knowing how to behave in a church.``I don't go to church. I'm a Muslim, but I don't go toprayers,'' said a young man who gave his name only as Sami. ``I'maccompanying my Christian friends. We lost someone. We're mourning_ that's all.''(jo-pa-ls-jh)
