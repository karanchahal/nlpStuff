GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Officials offered no word Sunday on whatmight have caused the dance-hall fire that killed 60 young people,but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.And while the officials were telling journalists that they hadno answer to the technical question of why the fire happened,thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to layflowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical ``why?''that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.``Why wasn't I there?'' sobbed a young woman as she turned awayfrom the 200-meter-long (600-foot-long) mound of bouquets andflickering candles that has grown outside the gutted building.The hunger for any answer at all was apparent at an afternoonnews conference when chief prosecutor Hans Carlsson was describingthe investigation into the fire that broke out just before midnightThursday and used the Swedish word for ``scene of the crime.''Journalists immediately barraged him with questions: Why do youuse that word; does it mean the fire definitely was set?``It was a slip of the tongue,'' Carlsson said. ``We have notarrested anyone. We have no suspect.''``Such a fire site is considered to be a crime scene until theopposite is proved,'' said Ralf Johansson, head of the policetechnical division in Goteborg.That is exactly what investigators have not been able to prove,and speculation that the fire was set ran high.The newspaper Expressen reported Sunday that police were toldjust hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injuredclaimed to know who set the fire.The Aftonbladet newspaper reported meanwhile that several teenshad been ejected from the dance shortly before the fire began, adetail raising the possibility that they might have set the blazein revenge.The newspaper also reported that one of the dance arrangersnoticed that the fusebox for the dance's sound system had at leastone fuse replaced by a nail.Witness reports on how the fire started have given differentversions.Timur Sklyavov, 16, told The Associated Press on Sunday that hehad been dancing near one of the loudspeakers and saw it explode.He saidd his 15-year-old girfriend died in the fire.``I was dancing (by myself) so I didn't know where she was. Ifeel guilty,'' he said, close to tears as he stood near the flowersand candles at the fire site. ``When I saw the fire, I ran out.''But the disc jockey has said he first saw smoke coming up theemergency exit stairway, located just behind where the sound systemwas set up.It's known that fire blocked dancers from using that staircase,forcing panicked dancers to seek escape by fleeing for the oneremaining stairway or leaping out of second-story windows. The hallwas crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150; witnesseshave estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.The fact that the emergency exit was burning ``is a circumstancethat indicates the fire could have been set,'' Johansson was quotedas telling the newspaper Aftonbladet.Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded withwooden furniture, Expressen reported.Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, bothdied in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalizedwith injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died whenshe went back in to try to save Jasmin.Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants fromtroubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.``We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to growup with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.Goteborg, with 435,000 is Sweden's second-largest city, on thecountry's west coast some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest ofStockholm.(jo-jh)
