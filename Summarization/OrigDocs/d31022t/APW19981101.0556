	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Officials offered no word Sunday on what
might have caused the dance-hall fire that killed 60 young people,
but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.
	   And while the officials were telling journalists that they had
no answer to the technical question of why the fire happened,
thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to lay
flowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical ``why?''
that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.
	   ``Why wasn't I there?'' sobbed a young woman as she turned away
from the 200-meter-long (600-foot-long) mound of bouquets and
flickering candles that has grown outside the gutted building.
	   The hunger for any answer at all was apparent at an afternoon
news conference when chief prosecutor Hans Carlsson was describing
the investigation into the fire that broke out just before midnight
Thursday and used the Swedish word for ``scene of the crime.''
	   Journalists immediately barraged him with questions: Why do you
use that word; does it mean the fire definitely was set?
	   ``It was a slip of the tongue,'' Carlsson said. ``We have not
arrested anyone. We have no suspect.''
	   ``Such a fire site is considered to be a crime scene until the
opposite is proved,'' said Ralf Johansson, head of the police
technical division in Goteborg.
	   That is exactly what investigators have not been able to prove,
and speculation that the fire was set ran high.
	   The newspaper Expressen reported Sunday that police were told
just hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured
claimed to know who set the fire.
	   The Aftonbladet newspaper reported meanwhile that several teens
had been ejected from the dance shortly before the fire began, a
detail raising the possibility that they might have set the blaze
in revenge.
	   The newspaper also reported that one of the dance arrangers
noticed that the fusebox for the dance's sound system had at least
one fuse replaced by a nail.
	   Witness reports on how the fire started have given different
versions.
	   Timur Sklyavov, 16, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he
had been dancing near one of the loudspeakers and saw it explode.
He saidd his 15-year-old girfriend died in the fire.
	   ``I was dancing (by myself) so I didn't know where she was. I
feel guilty,'' he said, close to tears as he stood near the flowers
and candles at the fire site. ``When I saw the fire, I ran out.''
	   But the disc jockey has said he first saw smoke coming up the
emergency exit stairway, located just behind where the sound system
was set up.
	   It's known that fire blocked dancers from using that staircase,
forcing panicked dancers to seek escape by fleeing for the one
remaining stairway or leaping out of second-story windows. The hall
was crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150; witnesses
have estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.
	   The fact that the emergency exit was burning ``is a circumstance
that indicates the fire could have been set,'' Johansson was quoted
as telling the newspaper Aftonbladet.
	   Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with
wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
	   Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
	   The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:
12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, both
died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized
with injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when
she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
	   Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from
troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.
	   ``We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to grow
up with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,
Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.
	   Goteborg, with 435,000 is Sweden's second-largest city, on the
country's west coast some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.
