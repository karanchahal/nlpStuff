GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Forensic experts examining heavilyburned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 youngpeople who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's mosttormenting question was still unanswered.How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through ahall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits andforcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remainingstaircase and leap out of second-story windows?''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause ofthe fire, we don't know if it's arson or not,'' Goteborg chiefprosecutor Ulf Noren said Saturday evening.Earlier in the day, Noren had said it was a ''50-50'' chancethat the fire was arson, prompting wide speculation thatauthorities had tracked down new clues. But Noren later retractedthe remark, saying he'd meant only that no possibilities were beingexcluded.As investigators worked to find the cause, examiners identifiedanother 22 of the bodies, bringing the total to 40, and officialssaid 49 people were released from hospital.Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in theThursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized. Most of the victimswere immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries includingIraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made inheavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and thecaller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by severalminutes.Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said thecall was so hard to understand that it took three minutes forworkers to figure out what was going on and where to send firetrucks.The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene sixminutes after the call was received, Ortarsen told a newsconference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether aquicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrantvictims.But the minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in theterror of the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what theysaw as a slow and even obstructive response.``No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, oneof the disc jockeys at the bash said Friday, hours after the blazeexploded. ``Just kids helping kids.''And once the squads arrived, the kids were then blocked fromhelping, they say.``We could have saved more young people if only police hadn'tstopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by thenewspaper Expressen.On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the guttedbuilding amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come togrips with catastrophe.In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult ofambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you inheaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading themalso had few words.``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There'snothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't knowany of the fire's victims.''It's damn difficult,'' said Connie Mesfin, who said she lost afriend in the blaze.Lasse Gustafsson, a former Goteborg firefighter severelydisfigured in an explosion, also came to the club site to try toshow the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help thempull through despair.``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, aspeople nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similarshocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say theexplosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the hall to 600degrees (1,100 F).The hall was packed far beyond its capacity. Licensed to hold amaximum of 150, the hall held at least 250 and perhaps as many as400 when the fire hit.One of the two exit stairways was blocked by fire and there wereconflicting statements from witnesses as to whether the fire cameup the stairs from a lower level, or whether it spread there afterbreaking out in the second-floor rooms.The worst previous fire disaster in modern Sweden was in 1978 inBoraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire. Goteborg, Sweden'ssecond-largest city with about 435,000 people, is 500 kilometers(300 miles) southwest of Stockholm.(pvs-jo-jh)
