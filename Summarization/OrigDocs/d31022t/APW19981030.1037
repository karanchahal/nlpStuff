GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed withteen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people andinjuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figureFriday evening. ''The earlier information that police gave out waswrong,'' Hand Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a newsconference.The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes beforemidnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing ahideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likenedto a ``gas chamber.'' The cause of the fire had not been determinedas of Friday evening.Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were atthe dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approvalfor a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson.The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association localimmigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history. In1978, 20 people died in a fire at a hotel in the town of Boraas.Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonousgases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and one other died later.Of the injured, at least 57 were in intensive care, according toSven Martinell, spokesman for the local medical authorities.The building did not have sprinklers and was not required tohave them, officials said.The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children ofimmigrants. Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians andSwedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia andunspecified Latin American countries.The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building,had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance,Carlsson said. That person was not immdiately identified.Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he sawthe fire. He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people,including a friend. ``His clothes had burned off. His skin was redand bubbly,'' Atta said.``Lots of kids were just screaming,'' he added at HammarkullenLutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victimsgathered. ``I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped. Theydidn't even look down'' beforehand.Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. (2243 GMT) Thursdayand had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescueworkers said. The blaze was already consuming the building.The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked byfire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as sayingby the Swedish news agency TT.``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said,with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youthsscuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends.Olin said there were indications that the fire could have beenset. ``The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not anormal fire,'' he said.Goteborg is about 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of thecapital, Stockholm.The crowd in the second story of the building contained mostly13 to 18 year olds celebrating Halloween and a holiday weekend.``A night full of expectation, happiness over extra leave fromschool and high spirits in anticipation of a weekend was brutallyand suddenly changed into a tragedy of incomprehensibledimensions,'' the Goteborg city council said in a statement.``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at middayand King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor whenthe blaze started with about 400 people inside.``It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps andloudspeakers fell to the floor,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It waschaos. Everybody was trying to get out and people trampled on eachother on the way to the exit. ... Others kicked out the windows andjumped out.''Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities. TheGoteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service tohelp transport the injured.Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where manyof the victims were taken, said identifying many of them wasdifficult.``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...They maybe don't have their own identification, but have that of afriend who is a year older. Girls don't carry their identificationon them, but in a bag and maybe that wasn't lying with the body,''she said, according to TT.Goteborg has about 435,000 people.(jh)
