GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A panicky telephone call in poor Swedishwas the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through adance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads'response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officialssaid Saturday.Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said thecall was so hard to understand that it took three minutes forworkers to figure out what was going on and where to send firetrucks.The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene sixminutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a newsconference. He and other officials declined to comment on whether aquicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrantvictims.The minutes of delay felt endless to those caught in the terrorof the fire and survivors have spoken angrily of what they saw as aslow and even obstructive response.''No help. No police. No firemen,'' 17-year-old Zuhir Hersi, oneof the disc jockeys at the bash, said Friday, hours after the blazeexploded. ''Just kids helping kids.''And once the squads arrived, the kids were blocked from helping,they say.''We could have saved more young people if only police hadn'tstopped us,'' Mohanned Hussein was quoted as saying by thenewspaper Expressen.On Saturday, hundreds of people stood quietly outside the guttedbuilding amid flowers and candles as they attempted to come togrips with catastrophe.In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult ofambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long(100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.The cards' inscriptions were brief _ ``I will see you inheaven,'' ``We miss you'' _ and the people who stood reading themalso had few words.``I just wanted to show my sympathy. I think about them. There'snothing else we can do,'' said Caroline Ericsson, who didn't knowany of the victims.For Lasse Gustavsson, having the right words wasn't as importantas showing his face, severely disfigured in a fire. The formerGoteborg firefighter lost his ears, his eyelids and most of hisnose in a gas explosion.By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relativesand friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.``I can't give them hope. Consolation is enough,'' he said, aspeople nearby cast uneasy glances at his scars.Many of those injured in the blaze may have to endure similarshocked looks the rest of their lives. Authorities say theexplosive fire quickly raised the temperature in the overcrowdedhall to 600 degrees (1,100 F).The cause of the fire that broke out just before midnightThursday remains under investigation. Witness accounts have variedwidely, with some reporting smoke coming from the cellar and otherssaying the fire appeared to start in the ceiling of the dance hallon the building's second floor.The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it couldhave been set, but officials also say the explosive spread couldhave been because the fire had been burning undetected for sometime.What's known is that the hall was packed far beyond itscapacity. Licensed to hold a maximum of 150, the hall held at least250 and perhaps as many as 400 when the fire hit.The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants orchildren of immigrant parents. They had come for a dance organizedby eight party-arrangers whom police have not identified; the hallwas rented by the organizers from the local Macedonian immigrantassociation.Officials said the dead and injured were of 19 nationalities,including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, as wellas people from the current and former Yugoslavia and unspecifiedLatin American countries.Identifying the dead was a wrackingly slow process, forcingrelatives and friends already exhausted with dread to wait forhours at hospitals. Only 18 of the dead had been identified bymidday Saturday.``The identification is hard because they have no driver'slicenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said KerstinEinarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of435,000 residents about 300 miles (500 kilometers) west ofStockholm.The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history wasin 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.
