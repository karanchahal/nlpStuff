 
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ With no arrests reported in Friday night's
slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, the three doctors who publicly
acknowledge performing abortions in the Buffalo area remained in
seclusion Sunday as residents of this quiet Buffalo suburb reeled
from the news that a sniper could still be in their midst.
 
 
   Law enforcement officials from federal, state and local agencies
who met with Canadian investigators here Sunday would not comment
on their inquiry into the death of Slepian, the gynecologist and
obstetrician who was killed by a sniper as he sat in his kitchen.
 
 
   Abortion rights advocates said clinics in the area that perform
abortions had been promised stepped-up security by law enforcement
officials and would operate normally this week.
 
 
   Neither a spokeswoman for the FBI or federal and local police
officials would specify the security measures that would be taken.
 
 
   Lucinda Finnelly, the lawyer representing Buffalo GYN
Womenservices, an abortion clinic where Slepian frequently worked,
said that another physician who wished to remain anonymous had
treated patients who had been scheduled to see Slepian on Saturday.
Other abortion advocates said that since the slaying local
physicians had expressed their willingness to carry out abortions.
 
 
   ``Womenservices is determined to keep this going,'' Ms. Finnelly
said. ``That's what Bart would have wanted.''
 
 
   Many residents here who denounced the shooting refused to give
their names out of fear that Slepian's killer could strike again.
There was an obvious sense of concern over the sniper attack in
this picturesque suburb of 150,000, which was declared the
statistically safest city in America in a 1997 survey by Money
magazine.
 
 
   ``The fact that someone could come in and do something like this
is shocking,'' said Nick DiPirro, a retired high school
administrator. ``Things like this don't happen here.''
