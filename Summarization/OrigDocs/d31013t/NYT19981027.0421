BUFFALO, N.Y. _ With federal marshals posted outside andprotesters waving pictures of aborted fetuses from the sidewalk,the clinic where Dr. Barnett A. Slepian performed abortions untilhe was slain on Friday night reopened here Tuesday and its directorvowed to continue his work.Short-staffed even before Slepian was fatally shot by a sniperwho hid in a wooded field behind his home, the clinic, BuffaloWomen's Gynecological Services, scrambled to find doctors to coverhis schedule.But the clinic performed no abortions Tuesday and saw only a fewpatients, said the director, Marilynn Buckham. Instead, she said,the staff spent the day mourning. ``We needed to talk about theloss of our friend,'' she said after a series of staff meetings.``We discussed how badly we felt.''In a brief and tearful interview in her office, Ms. Buckham saidshe had received calls from doctors around the country who offeredto perform there and said some would be flying to Buffalo as earlyas Wednesday. ``We will be doing abortions,'' she said.The sniper attack that killed Slepian left many women here, mostof them poor or working-class, expressing outrage that a bullet haddeprived them at least temporarily of one of the few options theyhad to end an unwanted or unhealthy pregnancy.The clinic is the only one left in Buffalo, New York State'ssecond-largest city, that specializes in abortions.The anger could be seen in people like Karen Jones, 25, whodropped off a friend at the clinic Tuesday morning, only to beswarmed by anti-abortion protesters who screamed, ``Be strong!''and ``Save the baby!''``It's none of their business if someone wants to have anabortion,'' she said, nervously taking a drag from a cigarette asshe sat in her car, awaiting her friend. ``Are they going to bearound to help raise the baby? No they won't. This decision isbetween a woman and her God.''As the staff at the clinic scheduled appointments for the restof the week _ one staff member said the clinic was fully booked forThursday and Friday _ local and federal investigators reportedlittle progress in their search for the sniper who shot Slepian,52, through an undraped window as he stood in his kitchen in thenearby suburb of Amherst.The officials were working on the theory that his killing islinked to four other sniper attacks since 1994 on doctors whoperform abortions here and in Canada. Three of the attacks tookplace in Canada, and one in Rochester, though no one was killed.Tuesday, according to a friend, Lynne Slepian, the doctor'swidow, was trying to spend time alone with their four young sons,talking about what had happened to their father and theconsequences for their family.``Right now, she is worried about the kids' safety andwell-being,'' said the friend, Ellen Fink. ``Yes, she is worriedabout how she is going to support them. But that is tomorrow.''The federal government dispatched United States. Marshals hereTuesday to assist clinic workers in their efforts to reopen Tuesdaymorning, though there was no visible protection from local lawenforcement authorities.Federal officials said that the marshals would be on hand toprotect doctors who plan to arrive here from around the country tofill in for Slepian. They gave no further details.``We intend to provide a high level of security for the doctorsand patients who come here,'' said one federal law enforcementofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity.As for the women who live in this poor end of town, Slepian'sdeath stirred not only sadness but also practical concerns aboutwhat they will do should they or their daughters become pregnant.Sharon Ashley, 43, recalled that teen-age a friends showed up atthe clinic about a year ago, only to be confronted by anti-abortionprotesters who convinced her to keep the baby.In the end, she said, the young women was so unprepared to be amother that child welfare authorities took the child away.``They told her that they would help her,'' Ms. Ashely said ofthe anti-abortion protesters. ``But they didn't do anything. Theyleft that girl on her own. What you had was a child trying to raisea child.''She added: ``Doctor Slepian helped a lot of people. Women aroundher don't have many options now. I think what you are going to seeis young girls trying to give themselves abortions. It's like we'regoing back to the old days.''Nancy Roseboro, 31, remembers showing up at the clinic as ayoung girl to get an abortion after the man she lived with lefther. As far as she is concerned, Slepian gave her a second chance.``If I had had that child, I'd be stuck on welfare orsomething,'' she said. ``I was a child. I couldn't take care of myown self. How could I take care of a child? I think it was the bestdecision I could have made.''Betty Hodlen sees the issue in terms of class and race. Moreaffluent women, she says, can go to private doctors who willperform abortions. But poor women like herself have had to rely onpeople like Slepian.``He was a kind man, a good man,'' she said. ``I think a lot ofpeople in this community feel a sense of loss. This is an outrage.The anti-abortion people say they want to save lives, but they havealso taken lives now.''
