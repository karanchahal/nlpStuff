The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assaulton the small number of courageous physicians who still risk theirsafety to perform legal abortions in this country. Slepian was oneof only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y.,area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortiongroups had become routine over the past decade. He perseveredthrough courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choosewhether to bear a child.But a principled commitment to provide a constitutionallyprotected service could not stop the assassin's bullet that torethrough his kitchen window and into his back Friday night. Hisdeath shows again how tentative the right to abortion has become inthe face of terrorism by anti-choice fanatics.Their repeated acts of terrorism must be met with the severestpossible crackdown by law-enforcement authorities. If an armedpolice officer has to be stationed outside every abortionprovider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done. This isan assault not only on individual doctors but on the rights andliberties of all Americans.Last week the FBI joined Canadian authorities to investigate aseries of unsolved sniper shootings of doctors in Canada andwestern New York dating to 1994. In January, a week after the 25thanniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinicbombing in Birmingham, Ala., killed a security guard and severelywounded a nurse.Since 1993, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinicemployees and a clinic escort have been murdered. There have beenmore than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers in thelast five years. Arson and bombings at clinics have become socommon that many no longer make the national news.It is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in statelegislatures are working to dismantle reproductive rights bybanning certain procedures, such as so-called partial birthabortion, and by requiring waiting periods and parental consentbefore an abortion can be obtained. But those restrictions are atleast imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicialstruggle in a democracy.What is outrageous is the attempt to shut down abortions byillegal means _ by shooting the doctors or bombing the clinics orharassing the women seeking to exercise their constitutional right.Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced thebombings and shootings, but others seem reluctant to issue thestrong condemnations that are warranted.Indeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site liststhe names of doctors it says perform abortions, or ``crimes againsthumanity,'' with a code indicating whether they are ``working,''``wounded'' or a ``fatality.'' Such incendiary rhetoric, andfrequent accusations by some anti-abortionists that abortionproviders are committing murder, can only fuel more terrorism.The increase of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns ofharassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked tomake abortions harder to obtain. More than 80 percent of countiesin this country have no abortion provider. In 45 states, the numberof doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992.Slepian was among those who took a stand against restrictingreproductive freedom and paid with his life. Unless these bravedoctors are better protected, fewer doctors in the next generationwill be willing to place themselves and their families in suchdanger. That is what the terrorists want. They must not be allowedto succeed.
