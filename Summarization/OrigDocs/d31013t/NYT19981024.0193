Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician with a practice in suburbanBuffalo, N.Y., returned home from synagogue Friday night with hiswife, Lynn, and greeted his four sons. Then he stepped into hiskitchen, where a sniper's bullet crashed through a back window andstruck him in the chest, police said.He fell to the floor, calling for help, but he would die withintwo hours.Slepian was one of a handful of doctors who provide abortions inthe Buffalo area, and law-enforcement officials said Saturday thathis slaying was the most deadly example of what they described asan annual pattern of anti-abortion violence in Canada and westernNew York. Slepian had endured years of picketing and harassment,and earlier on Friday he had received a warning about possibleattacks against abortion providers.Slepian, 51, is the third abortion doctor killed in the UnitedStates since 1993. In the past four years, three Canadian doctorsand a doctor in Rochester, N.Y., all of whom performed abortions,have been wounded by snipers. Each of the shootings occurred withina few weeks of Nov. 11, Veteran's Day, also known as RemembranceDay in Canada.President Clinton said Saturday that he was ``outraged'' bySlepian's slaying and that the Justice Department was working withlocal authorities to track down his killer.New York Gov. George Pataki said the killer should face thedeath penalty.``It's beyond a tragedy _ it's really an act of terrorism and,in my mind, a cold-blooded assassination,'' Pataki said in Buffalo.Susan Ward, a spokeswoman for Buffalo GYN Women's Services, theprivate clinic where Slepian performed abortions, said the NationalAbortion Federation had faxed a warning to the clinic Fridaymorning reminding them about the four-year pattern of attacks. Ms.Ward said the fax was sent to Slepian at his private office inAmherst.``He was aware of the threat,'' she said. ``Around this time ofyear, there had been shootings.''Amherst police said the timing of the shootings was not the onlysimilarity. In each case, police said a gunman, using ahigh-powered rifle, fired through a window into the home of thedoctors. Last November, a doctor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was shot inthe shoulder by a bullet fired through a window.Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said local investigators aswell as FBI agents and Canadian authorities were looking at thepossibility that the same gunman could be responsible for all ofthe shootings. A task force of several Canadian and U.S. lawenforcement agencies has been investigating the attacks for morethan a year.National abortion-rights advocates expressed concern that theslaying signaled a renewed escalation of violence against abortionproviders.The gunman who shot Slepian apparently hid in a strip of woodsbehind the house, then fired a single shot from a high-poweredrifle, Olesko said. Local police, FBI agents and Canadianinvestigators searched the woods Saturday, but the identity andwhereabouts of the suspect remained unknown.Shalom Press, another Amherst abortion provider who had knownSlepian for years, said, ``He believed women had the right to havean abortion, and he followed his conscience.''The slaying comes more than six years after anti-abortionprotesters descended on Buffalo. In April 1992, the city was thesetting for a coordinated series of ``Spring of Life'' protests ledby members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. Nearly 200protesters were arrested during one demonstration, andabortion-rights groups held counter protests. Police said Slepianwas one of the doctors singled out by picketers.In interviews with The Buffalo News, Slepian said he took therhetoric of abortion opponents seriously.In April 1993, one month after the shooting death of aPensacola, Fla., abortion provider, David Gunn, Slepian spoke aboutthe vulnerability of doctors who provide abortions.``It probably hits home a little bit because it could have beenme,'' Slepian told The Buffalo News. ``For years I've felt, and Istill feel, it could happen to me or to someone around here.''And in 1995, he told The News: ``When you're using words like`kill' and `murder,' that's where it can lead. If therosary-holding churchgoers and the bishop don't think that's true,they're fooling themselves.''In 1988, Slepian had clashed with anti-abortion protestersoutside his home. Protesters had taunted him during the Jewishholiday of Hanukkah, calling him a ``murderer.'' One protesterlater claimed that Slepian had attacked him with a baseball bat,though the case was later settled.Slepian divided his practice between the clinic in Buffalo andhis private office in Amherst. Ms. Ward, the clinic spokeswoman,said he had worked at that and other clinics for 15 years.``He has been harassed right in front of his house,'' she said.``His children have been harassed.'' She called him a courageousman who followed his principles.A woman from Attica, N.Y., who identified herself only as Susan,stood outside his Amherst office Saturday, weeping. She saidSlepian should not be portrayed solely as an ``abortion doctor.''She said he had delivered her niece and her daughter and that hekept a photo album of the hundreds of babies that he had delivered.``To me, he was about babies, not abortion,'' Susan said. Shesaid she had gone to him every three months for the past four yearsfor treatment of cervical cancer. ``I feel he saved my life. I feelhe is like a member of my family.''In Slepian's affluent Amherst neighborhood of large homes, therewas a sense of shock that this protected world could be violated.The slogan on Amherst police cars reads, ``Safest Town inAmerica.''``Every once in a while,'' said David Guercio, 49, a neighborwalking by the Slepian home Saturday, ``we get a pumpkin smashedaround here, but that's about it.''Another neighbor, Neel Chary, said Slepian's four sons had toldhim of a horrible scene. ``They just went into a panic,'' Charysaid. ``The oldest one called the grandpa and said, `Grandpa,Grandpa, Dad's been shot.'''
