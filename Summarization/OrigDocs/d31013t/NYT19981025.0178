AMHERST, N.Y. _ Some of those whom knew him said Dr. BarnettSlepian continued to perform abortions in the face of death threatsbecause he had what one friend called ``a stubborn kind ofcourage.''Others said he persisted because he was simply a conscientiousdoctor and made his decisions not on ideological grounds butbecause he wanted to practice the full range of gynecologicalmedicine just as he had been trained to do, even if that includedthe procedures that many in the aggressive anti-abortion movementin western New York equated with murder.``Having babies come into the world was his life,'' said EllenFink, a longtime friend. ``But he performed abortions because hebelieved it was a women's legal right to choose.''Slepian, a 52-year-old gynecologist and obstetrician who livedin this suburb of Buffalo, was shot fatally in the back Fridaynight as he stood in the kitchen of his home chatting with hiswife, Lynne, and his 15-year-old son, Andrew. He had just returnedfrom synagogue where he had gone to mark the yahrzeit _ oranniversary _ of his father's death with the Jewish prayer, thekaddish.On Sunday, his friends, patients and relatives were heartsick athis murder, but also fearful of what they could say because thesniper who lay in wait in the woods behind Slepian's house and shothim with a high-powered rifle through an undraped window is atlarge. Still, a few took time to talk to reporters because, theysaid, they wanted to make sure the man they knew was portrayed notas a narrow pro-abortion zealot but as a well-rounded doctor,father and husband.Slepian, who as a young man was so determined to become a doctorthat he studied medicine in Spanish in Guadalajara, Mexico, whenU.S. schools would not accept him, was a person who prized his timewith his four sons, Andrew, 15, Brian 13, Michael, 10 and Philip,7. He capered with them in their backyard swimming pool or taughtthem the value of work and money by having them mow the lawn insummer and shovel the driveway in winter. He was a devoted jogger,having run a marathon, and was what one friend said was ``a healthnut'' who was meticulous about his family's health and carefullywatched such demons as cholesterol and salt. He belonged to aReform synagogue, Temple Beth Am.He was painfully aware that he and his family could be thetarget of a fierce opponent of abortions and took precautions.There had been four attacks against doctors on both side of theU.S.-Canadian border. As recently as Friday morning, Slepianreceived a two-page warning from the downtown Buffalo clinic wherehe worked urging him to beware of sniper attacks.``Do not assume that you are safe once you are at home,'' thewarning said. ``Close the drapes in your house so you are notvisible from outside.''In fact, Slepian often kept the blinds drawn at home and hecalled the police whenever he received a death threat. Neighborssaid there were a number of periods when an Amherst patrol car wasstationed outside Slepian's two-story brick colonial in awell-to-do enclave here.But he refused to change his approach to medicine, even when hisfriends warned him some anti-abortion protesters would view hisdeath as a ``coup'' that virtually eliminated access to abortion inthe Buffalo area.``He knew the risks well,'' said Glenn Edward Murray, who wasSlepian's lawyer and longtime friend. ``We had discussed the fataldangers he placed himself in by continuing to perform abortions. Wediscussed security measures. He was dedicated to providing womenwith safe and legal abortions and was unwilling to abandon hisclients because of threats.''Murray, who talked in carefully measured tones but still foundhimself choked with emotion, said Slepian had as a young intern andresident in the Buffalo area been taught by mentors how dangerousand sometimes fatal ``back alley'' abortions performed by badpractitioners or by the women themselves could be. Even as he hadfour children of his own, he was determined that he would performabortions for women who needed them, no matter how poor they were.So in addition to a private practice he had in this leafysuburban town in the prairie-flat countryside east of Buffalo,Slepian chose to work regularly at a clinic in downtown Buffalothat had been singled out by protesters and was the last of itskind in Buffalo: Buffalo GYN Women's Services. Now, that clinic hasbeen left without a doctor.``He had a stubborn kind of courage,'' Murray said. ``He wasresolved not to let the threat eliminate the legal and medicaloptions for patients.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)His wife, Lynne, a trained nurse who stayed home in recent yearsto raise their sons, was as resolute as he was in not letting theprotesters stop her husband from practicing medicine as he saw fit.Slepian, a slender, wiry man with the bearded face of a scholar,was born in Cambridge, Mass., into a lower-middle class family offour children, each of whom went on to considerable accomplishmentas an adult. One of his two brothers, Jacob, is also a doctor,specializing in ear, nose and throat medicine.Slepian, whom friends called Bart, was raised in Rochester,attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado andreceived his medical degree from the Autonomous University ofGuadalajara. A residency at the State University of Buffalo broughthim to this area 20 years ago, and he stayed.Although gynecologists will quietly perform abortions for theirlongtime paying patients, Slepian became one of only a handful ofdoctors in western New York who were willing to perform abortionsat public clinics and not hide the fact that they did. Nonetheless,his friends said, he counseled women seeking abortion to consideralternatives like adoption. In 1988, protesters taunted him outsidehis home on Hanukkah. When he emerged carrying a baseball bat, aclash ensued and Slepian was eventually charged with a misdemeanorfor damaging a protester's vehicle. In 1992 he again became atarget in a coordinated protest by 200 picketers from theanti-abortion group Operation Rescue that was known as ``Spring ofLife.''In recent years, patients who visited him at the downtown clinicor his private office in Amherst periodically endured shouts frompicketers of ``You're murdering your babies.'' A longtime patientwho asked that she be identified only as Karen said that Slepianfrequently apologized for the disruptions the protesters werecausing. Still, Karen said she knew him mainly as a devotedgynecologist who saw her through infertility treatments anddelivered her daughter.``He wasn't supposed to be there for the delivery but he cameanyway and when I asked him, `What are you doing here,' he said:``I wouldn't miss it for the world.'' Similarly, she said, he wentout of his way to visit another patient when she was in thehospital for a non-gynecological ailment. ``I thought I'd come overto have donuts and coffee with you when I heard you were in thehospital,'' Karen heard that he told the friend.``He was the type of man,'' Karen said, ``that I would put mylife in his hands and not question what he had to say. And I can'tsay that about all doctors.''
