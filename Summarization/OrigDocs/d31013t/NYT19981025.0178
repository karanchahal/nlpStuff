 
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Some of those whom knew him said Dr. Barnett
Slepian continued to perform abortions in the face of death threats
because he had what one friend called ``a stubborn kind of
courage.''
 
 
   Others said he persisted because he was simply a conscientious
doctor and made his decisions not on ideological grounds but
because he wanted to practice the full range of gynecological
medicine just as he had been trained to do, even if that included
the procedures that many in the aggressive anti-abortion movement
in western New York equated with murder.
 
 
   ``Having babies come into the world was his life,'' said Ellen
Fink, a longtime friend. ``But he performed abortions because he
believed it was a women's legal right to choose.''
 
 
   Slepian, a 52-year-old gynecologist and obstetrician who lived
in this suburb of Buffalo, was shot fatally in the back Friday
night as he stood in the kitchen of his home chatting with his
wife, Lynne, and his 15-year-old son, Andrew. He had just returned
from synagogue where he had gone to mark the yahrzeit _ or
anniversary _ of his father's death with the Jewish prayer, the
kaddish.
 
 
   On Sunday, his friends, patients and relatives were heartsick at
his murder, but also fearful of what they could say because the
sniper who lay in wait in the woods behind Slepian's house and shot
him with a high-powered rifle through an undraped window is at
large. Still, a few took time to talk to reporters because, they
said, they wanted to make sure the man they knew was portrayed not
as a narrow pro-abortion zealot but as a well-rounded doctor,
father and husband.
 
 
   Slepian, who as a young man was so determined to become a doctor
that he studied medicine in Spanish in Guadalajara, Mexico, when
U.S. schools would not accept him, was a person who prized his time
with his four sons, Andrew, 15, Brian 13, Michael, 10 and Philip,
7. He capered with them in their backyard swimming pool or taught
them the value of work and money by having them mow the lawn in
summer and shovel the driveway in winter. He was a devoted jogger,
having run a marathon, and was what one friend said was ``a health
nut'' who was meticulous about his family's health and carefully
watched such demons as cholesterol and salt. He belonged to a
Reform synagogue, Temple Beth Am.
 
 
   He was painfully aware that he and his family could be the
target of a fierce opponent of abortions and took precautions.
There had been four attacks against doctors on both side of the
U.S.-Canadian border. As recently as Friday morning, Slepian
received a two-page warning from the downtown Buffalo clinic where
he worked urging him to beware of sniper attacks.
 
 
   ``Do not assume that you are safe once you are at home,'' the
warning said. ``Close the drapes in your house so you are not
visible from outside.''
 
 
   In fact, Slepian often kept the blinds drawn at home and he
called the police whenever he received a death threat. Neighbors
said there were a number of periods when an Amherst patrol car was
stationed outside Slepian's two-story brick colonial in a
well-to-do enclave here.
 
 
   But he refused to change his approach to medicine, even when his
friends warned him some anti-abortion protesters would view his
death as a ``coup'' that virtually eliminated access to abortion in
the Buffalo area.
 
 
   ``He knew the risks well,'' said Glenn Edward Murray, who was
Slepian's lawyer and longtime friend. ``We had discussed the fatal
dangers he placed himself in by continuing to perform abortions. We
discussed security measures. He was dedicated to providing women
with safe and legal abortions and was unwilling to abandon his
clients because of threats.''
 
 
   Murray, who talked in carefully measured tones but still found
himself choked with emotion, said Slepian had as a young intern and
resident in the Buffalo area been taught by mentors how dangerous
and sometimes fatal ``back alley'' abortions performed by bad
practitioners or by the women themselves could be. Even as he had
four children of his own, he was determined that he would perform
abortions for women who needed them, no matter how poor they were.
 
 
   So in addition to a private practice he had in this leafy
suburban town in the prairie-flat countryside east of Buffalo,
Slepian chose to work regularly at a clinic in downtown Buffalo
that had been singled out by protesters and was the last of its
kind in Buffalo: Buffalo GYN Women's Services. Now, that clinic has
been left without a doctor.
 
 
   ``He had a stubborn kind of courage,'' Murray said. ``He was
resolved not to let the threat eliminate the legal and medical
options for patients.''
 
 
   His wife, Lynne, a trained nurse who stayed home in recent years
to raise their sons, was as resolute as he was in not letting the
protesters stop her husband from practicing medicine as he saw fit.
 
 
   Slepian, a slender, wiry man with the bearded face of a scholar,
was born in Cambridge, Mass., into a lower-middle class family of
four children, each of whom went on to considerable accomplishment
as an adult. One of his two brothers, Jacob, is also a doctor,
specializing in ear, nose and throat medicine.
 
 
   Slepian, whom friends called Bart, was raised in Rochester,
attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado and
received his medical degree from the Autonomous University of
Guadalajara. A residency at the State University of Buffalo brought
him to this area 20 years ago, and he stayed.
 
 
   Although gynecologists will quietly perform abortions for their
longtime paying patients, Slepian became one of only a handful of
doctors in western New York who were willing to perform abortions
at public clinics and not hide the fact that they did. Nonetheless,
his friends said, he counseled women seeking abortion to consider
alternatives like adoption. In 1988, protesters taunted him outside
his home on Hanukkah. When he emerged carrying a baseball bat, a
clash ensued and Slepian was eventually charged with a misdemeanor
for damaging a protester's vehicle. In 1992 he again became a
target in a coordinated protest by 200 picketers from the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue that was known as ``Spring of
Life.''
 
 
   In recent years, patients who visited him at the downtown clinic
or his private office in Amherst periodically endured shouts from
picketers of ``You're murdering your babies.'' A longtime patient
who asked that she be identified only as Karen said that Slepian
frequently apologized for the disruptions the protesters were
causing. Still, Karen said she knew him mainly as a devoted
gynecologist who saw her through infertility treatments and
delivered her daughter.
 
 
   ``He wasn't supposed to be there for the delivery but he came
anyway and when I asked him, `What are you doing here,' he said:
``I wouldn't miss it for the world.'' Similarly, she said, he went
out of his way to visit another patient when she was in the
hospital for a non-gynecological ailment. ``I thought I'd come over
to have donuts and coffee with you when I heard you were in the
hospital,'' Karen heard that he told the friend.
 
 
   ``He was the type of man,'' Karen said, ``that I would put my
life in his hands and not question what he had to say. And I can't
say that about all doctors.''
