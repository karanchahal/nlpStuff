The killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalowho performed abortions, has become a factor in at least twocampaigns in New York, say political consultants and some campaignadvisers.In the race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate,Eliot Spitzer, who favors abortion rights, has moved quickly tomake the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney GeneralDennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.And in the tight race for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat,Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has not raisedSlepian's death himself, his aides say it puts a new emphasis onthe issue.Slepian was shot in the back on Friday night as he stood in hiskitchen. No suspects have been identified. Even before the killing,Schumer was tyring to draw more attention to the anti-abortionrecord of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican whois also running on the Right to Life Party line.In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed on Saturday, 69percent of those polled said they did not know D'Amato's positionon abortion, and only 19 percent knew that he opposed abortionrights.Now events are doing the work for Schumer. Slepian's death wasamong the first topics raised in Saturday night's debate betweenthe two men, and it was instantly followed by a question to D'Amatoon whether he opposed first-trimester abortions for adult women.On Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights ActionLeague plans to hold a news conference to screen a televisionadvertisement _ made last week, before Slepian died _ featuringEmily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year in thebombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama.The advertisement, said Kelli Conlin, the executive director ofthe New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended to spotlightD'Amato's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to ClinicEntrances Act, which Schumer sponsored. The measure made it aFederal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic. Now, Ms.Conlin said, it will have new resonance, and the organization isconsidering buying more air time.``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have beenregardless,'' she said. ``But sensitivities are so heightened fromthe shooting in western New York that it's even more powerful.''David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is notworking for anyone in this year's campaign, said abortion ``is nolonger the driving issue it once was, at least on the pro-choiceside.''But, Eichenbaum said: ``Sometimes an incident like this will domore to energize those who are pro-choice who otherwise might notconsider that as an important an issue to go to the polls over. Itbrings it home.''D'Amato's aides would not comment about the politicalramifications of the slaying, and Schumer's aides would not talkabout whether they planned to refer to it in any advertisements, orwhether the candidate planned to use it on the campaign trail.``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree this was ahorrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' said Josh Isay, Schumer'scampaign manager.But, Isay added, ``it heightens the abortion issue.''Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was lessreticent. ``Eliot is going to make a huge priority of this,''Goldstein said. ``Stopping clinic violence is going to be a majortheme of our campaign from now to Election Day.''In Sunday's debate against Vacco, Spitzer attacked him forfailing to enforce a court order in 1992 against anti-abortionprotesters who had blocked the entrance to a clinic. It was thesame clinic where Slepian worked.A federal judge removed Vacco, then the U.S. attorney forwestern New York, from the case. He was replaced with two specialprosecutors. Spitzer also criticized Vacco for dismantling theOffice of Reproductive Rights, which investigated threats andcrimes against abortion clinics, when he became attorney general.On Monday, Spitzer called for Vacco to revive that unitimmediately, vowing that he would do so on his first day in officeif elected.Goldstein, who said it was ``thoroughly, thoroughly possible''that the issue would surface in Spitzer's advertisements, defendedthe use of the issue by noting that the attorney general has directimpact on the issue of clinic access.Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said in a statementthat Spitzer had ``sunk to a new and despicable low by attemptingto capitalize on the murder of a physician in order to garnervotes.''``It's possible that New York politics has never seen anythingas crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness to exploit the unfortunatemurder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own politicalambitions,'' Berhrmann said.Several consultants agreed that there might be political hay tobe made in Slepian's death but that it had to be done carefully.``Trying to score political points from a homicide can have abacklash,'' said Maureen Connelly, a media consultant not workingfor any candidate in next week's election.
