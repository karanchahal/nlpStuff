 
   Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer in Carrollton,
Ga., does not understand what the fuss is about.
 
 
   Three years ago, he established a Web site called ``The
Nuremberg Files,'' a list attempting, in his words, ``to record the
name of every person working in the baby slaughter business across
the United States of America.''
 
 
   Each name in the list is either in black type, meaning
``working''; in gray, meaning ``wounded;'' or has a line through
it, meaning ``fatality.''
 
 
   In an interview Sunday, Horsley said that shortly after hearing
news reports Friday night that a doctor who performed abortions had
been shot and killed in his kitchen in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.,
he drew a line through the name of the doctor, Barnett Slepian, on
the Web site.
 
 
   Abortion-rights organizations have denounced his action,
implying that Horsley may have crossed out Slepian's name before he
was killed.
 
 
   ``I certainly did not have advance information,'' Horsley said.
``I'm the only one who can change anything on the Web site. That's
tantamount to saying I knew of and advocated his death. What is
that? Libel or slander?''
 
 
   Asked to define his role and that of his Web site, Horsley
replied: ``I'm a reporter. I am simply a journalist.''
 
 
   Law-enforcement officials would not discuss the investigation of
the Slepian killing Sunday, but no one has suggested that the Web
site had any connection with the attack.
 
 
   Horsley said the goal of the Web site was to gather information
about doctors who perform abortions so they could be arrested and
punished should abortion be made illegal once again. He said he did
not want abortion doctors to escape prosecution for lack of
evidence, as happened with some Nazi war criminals, and so he
called the site ``The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists on
Trial'' (http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/).
 
 
   Visitors to the Web site are asked to provide a wide variety of
information about people who perform or aid in abortions. The
information includes photos or videotapes of the doctors, their
cars, houses, and friends; criminal records, including driving
record, mug shots, and fingerprint card; and civil suit records,
including ``informative depositions and divorce file (if any).''
 
 
   Horsley said he received his information through e-mail and
regular mail from anti-abortion activists and said he did not
regard the compiling of such information as an incitement to
violence. ``I have no power to stop them,'' he said.
 
 
   Asked about animation that depicts dripping blood under his
request for viewers to ``e-mail evidence or feedback,'' he replied:
``That is the blood of the unborn.''
 
 
   Horsley said he first became aware of Slepian's death ``sometime
after sunup'' on Saturday morning through an E-mail or a report on
a computerized wire service.
 
 
   ``I did not have a feeling of guilt when I saw it,'' he said.
``I did not have a feeling of sadness. We're involved in a war.
There are 4,000 babies a day being killed. To do this work, you
have to be like a policeman dealing with the reality of corpses.''
 
 
   He said he had not received communication from anyone taking
responsibility for Slepian's death or other attacks on people who
perform or aid in abortions.
 
 
   The Web site has recorded 180,000 to 220,000 visits per month in
the last two years, Horsley said. On Friday, there were 7,886
visits and on Saturday, 18,295. Data for Sunday were not available
Sunday night.
