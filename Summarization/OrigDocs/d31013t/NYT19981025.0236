Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer in Carrollton,Ga., does not understand what the fuss is about.Three years ago, he established a Web site called ``TheNuremberg Files,'' a list attempting, in his words, ``to record thename of every person working in the baby slaughter business acrossthe United States of America.''Each name in the list is either in black type, meaning``working''; in gray, meaning ``wounded;'' or has a line throughit, meaning ``fatality.''In an interview Sunday, Horsley said that shortly after hearingnews reports Friday night that a doctor who performed abortions hadbeen shot and killed in his kitchen in a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.,he drew a line through the name of the doctor, Barnett Slepian, onthe Web site.Abortion-rights organizations have denounced his action,implying that Horsley may have crossed out Slepian's name before hewas killed.``I certainly did not have advance information,'' Horsley said.``I'm the only one who can change anything on the Web site. That'stantamount to saying I knew of and advocated his death. What isthat? Libel or slander?''Asked to define his role and that of his Web site, Horsleyreplied: ``I'm a reporter. I am simply a journalist.''Law-enforcement officials would not discuss the investigation ofthe Slepian killing Sunday, but no one has suggested that the Website had any connection with the attack.Horsley said the goal of the Web site was to gather informationabout doctors who perform abortions so they could be arrested andpunished should abortion be made illegal once again. He said he didnot want abortion doctors to escape prosecution for lack ofevidence, as happened with some Nazi war criminals, and so hecalled the site ``The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists onTrial'' (http://www.christiangallery.com/atrocity/).(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Visitors to the Web site are asked to provide a wide variety ofinformation about people who perform or aid in abortions. Theinformation includes photos or videotapes of the doctors, theircars, houses, and friends; criminal records, including drivingrecord, mug shots, and fingerprint card; and civil suit records,including ``informative depositions and divorce file (if any).''Horsley said he received his information through e-mail andregular mail from anti-abortion activists and said he did notregard the compiling of such information as an incitement toviolence. ``I have no power to stop them,'' he said.Asked about animation that depicts dripping blood under hisrequest for viewers to ``e-mail evidence or feedback,'' he replied:``That is the blood of the unborn.''Horsley said he first became aware of Slepian's death ``sometimeafter sunup'' on Saturday morning through an E-mail or a report ona computerized wire service.``I did not have a feeling of guilt when I saw it,'' he said.``I did not have a feeling of sadness. We're involved in a war.There are 4,000 babies a day being killed. To do this work, youhave to be like a policeman dealing with the reality of corpses.''He said he had not received communication from anyone takingresponsibility for Slepian's death or other attacks on people whoperform or aid in abortions.The Web site has recorded 180,000 to 220,000 visits per month inthe last two years, Horsley said. On Friday, there were 7,886visits and on Saturday, 18,295. Data for Sunday were not availableSunday night.
