NEW YORK _ In the second and final debate in the race for stateattorney general, Eliot Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, accusedRepublican incumbent Dennis Vacco on Sunday of ignoring the threatposed by radical anti-abortion advocates, thereby helping to easethe way for this weekend's slaying of an obstetrician.The obstetrician, Dr. Barnett Slepian, was killed by a sniper onFriday night at his home in a Buffalo suburb. Spitzer seized on theshooting again and again during their half-hour debate, which wasbroadcast live on WABC-TV in Manhattan and shown on other networkaffiliates across the state.Spitzer cited a ruling in 1992 in which a federal judge rebukedVacco, who was then the U.S. attorney for western New York, forfailing to pursue contempt charges when protesters violated a courtorder against blocking the entrance to a clinic where Slepian wasworking. The judge, Richard Arcara of Buffalo, took the rare stepof removing Vacco from the case and replacing him with two specialprosecutors.Spitzer, speaking of his opponent, said, ``The horror thatoccurred the other night should weigh heavily on his conscience.''He also chided Vacco for getting rid of the Office of ReproductiveRights when he became attorney general. ``Mr. Vacco disbanded thevery unit that was to protect this doctor,'' Spitzer said.Vacco responded heatedly, assailing his opponent for exploitingthe slaying for political purposes. ``I think it borders on beingdespicable that Mr. Spitzer would try to seek political advantageat the expense of Dr. Slepian and Dr. Slepian's family,'' Vaccosaid.The incumbent, who is personally opposed to abortion, cited hissuccessful effort to win a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding aban on blocking abortion clinics.After the debate, Kelli Conlin, executive director of the NewYork chapter of the National Abortion and Reproductive RightsAction League, said that the case was started under Vacco'spredecessor.If anything, Sunday's debate was even nastier than the firstone, which was held in Woodbury, N.Y., on Friday. Vacco continuedhammering Spitzer for refusing to explain inconsistencies regardinghis campaign loans.Less than halfway through the debate, Vacco offered to yield therest of his time to Spitzer if he would reconcile his campaignspending. At issue is Spitzer's claim that he had used eightcooperative apartments he owns in Manhattan as collateral formillions of dollars of campaign loans with a document submitted tothe state by his father, Bernard Spitzer. Before the cameras, Vaccowaved a document in which the father, a real estate developer, hadsworn that the apartments were not being used as collateral.He suggested Spitzer was being less than candid about the sourceof his campaign financing. ``Show us the money,'' Vacco pleaded.As he did in the Friday debate, Spitzer provided only abare-bones response. ``The documents have been submitted,'' hesaid. ``The response is very simple, Mr. Vacco: You're wrong on thefacts, you're wrong on the law.''Pressed by reporters to say more on the issue after the debate,Spitzer said he would ``answer the facts at the right time'' anddeclined to elaborate.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Since those two issues occupied most of the half-hour allottedto the debate, the candidates had little time to spell out theirideological differences. Spitzer once again accused Vacco ofdiminishing the stature of the attorney general's office, pointingto reports that 80 percent of the people hired since Vacco tookover in 1994 had political connections. Vacco sought to deflectthat criticism by enumerating his accomplishments in fighting crimeand other areas.After the debate, two political analysts _ one a Republican, theother an independent _ said Spitzer's handling of the questionsabout his finances had harmed his campaign.``If it's so easy to explain, why didn't he remove it from themenu?'' said Jay Severin, the Republican strategist.John Zogby, an independent pollster in Utica, N.Y., said that ifSpitzer made a simple technical error, he has compounded it by hisreticence. ``That could be one of the things that causes Spitzer tosputter,'' he said. ``I think he's handled it very badly.''On the other hand, Severin said, Spitzer did well by respondingso quickly to Slepian's slaying. ``It is evidence of some skillpolitically that he was able to seize on it,'' he said.Since polls indicate that two of three New York voters favorabortion rights, Zogby said, it was a smart move for Spitzer tohome in on the shooting as a way to attract Democrats, moderateRepublicans and women to the polls.
