 
   Five sniper attacks against abortion doctors in Canada and the
United States have occurred in the last four years within a few
weeks of Nov. 11, or Veterans Day, a date observed as Remembrance
Day in Canada, but which some anti-abortion activists are said to
call ``Remember the Unborn Children Day.'' In each case, a sniper
fired a high-powered rifle from behind the doctor's home.
 
 
   Nov. 8, 1994, Vancouver, B.C. _ Dr. Garson Romalis, 57, is
eating breakfast in his kitchen at 7:10 a.m. when two bullets crash
through a sliding glass patio door. One shatters his thigh bone and
severs his femoral artery. He nearly bleeds to death, but makes a
tourniquet from his bathrobe belt and calls for help. The shooter
had fired at least three times from a wooded ravine behind the
house. The doctor's wife and daughter also are at home but are
unharmed. Police recover two shell casings from high-powered rifle
bullets behind the house.

watching television with his wife in a rear, second-floor den at
about 9:30 p.m. when a bullet comes through a window, shattering
his right elbow. A single shell casing is found in a wooded ravine
behind the home, in a suburb of Hamilton, Ont. After losing the use
of his hand, he stops practicing medicine.
 
 
   Oct. 28, 1997, Perinton, N.Y. _ An unidentified doctor is
standing by an indoor pool in the rear of his house in a suburb of

   Nov. 11, 1997, Winnipeg, Manitoba _ Dr. Jack Fainman, 66, is hit

few inches from his heart. Police dogs track footprints in fresh
snow behind his house to a park near the river nearby.
