MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief executive of the InternationalMonetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvementin global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and theUnited States.Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted world growthof around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the recentlyrevised-down figure for this year of 2 percent.Camdessus was in the Spanish capital to attend the fourthmeeting of the so-called Montevideo Circle, an informal gatheringof top ranking politicians and officials who annually hold abehind-closed-door brainstorming session on Latin American issues.The IMF chief told reporters that Europe and the United States _``the two motors of the world economy'' _ were still going strong,despite some slowdown in America and Great Britain.He said Asia should be able to keep its economic head just abovewater, avoiding negative growth next year.Camdessus said the immediate task was to ensure that LatinAmerica weathered the financial storm that began in Thailand 15months ago before spreading from Asia to precipitate Russia'srecent collapse.``It is a vital obligation to prevent the Latin domino fromfalling,'' Camdessus said, praising Spain's recent offer to helpfund emergency credits to the region under threat from investorflight.He said he hoped other European countries with businessinterests in Latin America _ such as Italy, France and Germany _would follow the Spanish example.The IMF and the Brazilian government are putting the finaltouches to an emergency three-year-package that should be ratifiedwithin weeks, Camdessus said. The package has been estimated tototal dlrs 30 billion.``Brazil will not collapse,'' he said, adding that Argentina andChile were among the keenest to see the IMF reach agreement withtheir giant neighbor.Less upbeat about Russia, Camdessus said the Fund was stillworking toward a financing package, but that the government stilllacked a program. This, he said, would take time, and appealed togovernments to provide humanitarian aid in the interim.The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling over $100billion during what Camdessus called ``the most uncertain yearever.''He said the crisis has underlined the need for prevention, andthe transformation of the Fund's primary role away from that of``the firefighter who arrives when the fire is already burning.''Greater private sector involvement in the prevention andresolution of future economic crisis would help, Camdessus said.``Now, the private sector tends to run away and leave the work tothe governments,'' he said.Camdessus also said he was aware of recent criticism ofexcessive IMF secrecy, but he said his own efforts to open up theFund have been blocked by governments demanding discretion.Camdessus said that those who viewed the crisis as a critique ofthe Fund's promotion of world economic liberalization weremistaken. The man who has headed the IMF for 12 years said that itsimply demonstrated the need to carry through liberalizationprograms properly.(jt/krt)
