WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and other economic powersmoved ahead Saturday toward an overhaul of the world's financialsystem to prevent widening market turmoil from pushing morecountries into recession.U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned British Prime MinisterTony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac to lobby personallyfor a set of proposals he put forward Friday. Central to the U.S.idea is to use the International Monetary Fund to provide moremoney, faster, to countries threatened with a flight of panickedinvestors.Blair and Chirac said they liked the U.S. approach, and othercountries as well have had favorable reactions in discussions withadministration economic officials, presidential spokesman JoeLockhart said.Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan, who helped develop the proposals, sought theendorsements of finance ministers and central bank presidents fromthe world's seven richest countries.After hearing Rubin explain the suggestion that new IMF creditlines be established for countries threatened with investor flight,Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters: ``He askedme to support it, and I said I would.''The Group of Seven meeting, at historic Blair House acrossPennsylvania Avenue from the White House was expected to be pivotalin trying to develop strategies to halt a 15-month economic crisis,as are sessions beginning Sunday of the 182-nation IMF and WorldBank. The World Bank generally loans money for development projectsin poor countries, and the IMF oversees rescue efforts forcountries experiencing financial difficulties.A collapse of currencies and stock markets triggered by a flightof foreign investment money has pushed several Asian nations intosteep recession, leveled the Russian economy and is now threateningto strike Brazil and other nations in Latin America.While other countries had their own ideas about how to addressthe current market turmoil, Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martinsaid he believes the crisis' urgency is molding ``a growingconsensus about what needs to be done.''Britain's top finance official, Chancellor of the ExchequerGordon Brown, also sounded a note of urgency and suggested that theBank of England might act as early as next week to cut interestrates. That would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve, which cuta key U.S. rate by a quarter-point last Tuesday to help ward offrecession in the United States.``As we meet here in Washington, we are conscious that more thana quarter of the world is in recession, that the second largesteconomy in the world, Japan, is in recession and that the socialcasualties of the Asian crisis are rising in numbers,'' Brown said.He told reporters ``strong, decisive and united leadership'' isneeded to turn talk into action.Finance ministers from 24 developing countries appealed forlower interest rates from major industrial nations as a way to takepressure off their foreign debt burdens and ``help restoreconfidence in international finance markets.''Still, it was far from certain that all differences will beresolved in coming days. U.S. officials already have rejected aFrench proposal to turn the IMF's interim committee into a morepermanent crisis-coordination body.``My guess is we won't find a silver bullet, but we will comeout with a process,'' World Bank President James Wolfensohn said.The U.S. proposal does prescribe new money for the IMF but wouldrequire Congress to approve the administration's request of dlrs 18billion to replenish IMF resources depleted by the need to assemblemore than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia,South Korea and Russia.That approval is in doubt given significant Republicanopposition in the House. GOP Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, saidClinton's call for quicker release of IMF money is precisely thewrong approach for an agency that has failed so far to halt thecrisis from widening.Other aspects of change being considered are to increase bankingsupervision in poor countries and provide more loans to helpstricken corporations in crisis countries get back on their feet.The United States also was pushing to get the IMF and otherdonors behind a rescue for Brazil of perhaps dlrs 30 billion, whichcould be announced soon after Sunday's presidential electionsthere.Rubin and Greenspan pressed the case for Japan to act moreforcefully in Saturday's discussions with Miyazawa. U.S. officialshave said troubled Asian countries cannot hope to resume growthunless Japan cleans up its banking troubles and emerges from itsown recession.In a Treasury statement, Rubin welcomed Japan's offer of dlrs 30billion in new loans to support other Asian nations and saidMiyazawa ``explained his government's intention to take allpossible steps to promote financial stability.''
