RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ When Josue da Silva stepped up to theconsumer society four years ago, the ground underfoot felt solidand endless.For the first time in years inflation in Brazil was undercontrol, and he and his wife had steady jobs. They moved out of acramped room behind a store into an apartment and signed to buyfurniture, appliances, a stereo system and even a car.But these days the foundation beneath da Silva is about the sizeof his wife's shoes. Out of work since June, he relies on the $40 aday that Mrs. da Silva earns cleaning houses, and he walks thestreets of Sao Paulo desperate for work.``I assumed commitments that I don't have any way of getting outof,'' da Silva, a former salesman in a building-supply store, said.``How could I know that in 1998 I'd be stopped dead? Our lives haveturned around more than 800 degrees.''As Brazilians prepare to vote on Sunday, polls predict thatPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso, highly acclaimed for puttinginflation under control, will handily win re-election.But behind the voters' preferences is a kaleidoscope of doubtsand difficulties that Brazilians face as their economy grinds to avirtual halt, and they prepare for the humiliation of ceding somedegree of sovereignty for an expected $30 billion in aid from theInternational Monetary Fund.The president's closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 52, aunion leader from the leftist Workers' Party, opposes the bailoutand says the administration lacks an effective industrial andemployment policy. Polls project that he will take 24 percent ofthe vote.While presidents and prime ministers, central bankers andeconomists debate whether low inflation should be a higher prioritythan economic growth, Brazilians ask the same question on a deeplypersonal level. After years of failed economic projects andhyperinflation of more than 200 percent a month just four yearsago, Brazilians see the global future as inevitable, although theyare not sure where they will land in this modern borderless worldof commerce.``The middle of a storm is not the time to change the ship'scaptain,'' said Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the Universityof Sao Paulo and at the State University of Rio de Janeiro,explaining the support for Cardoso. ``It doesn't mean the boat isnot sinking, though.''Last month Cardoso pledged to push Social Security and taxoverhauls through Congress and to thin the Civil Service rolls. Hisplans mirror those that he made four years ago, which were partlysacrificed because of his crusade for a constitutional amendmentthat let him seek re-election.The delay in trimming government spending heightened Brazil'svulnerability to the credit problem that is affecting emergingmarkets. The overnight doubling of effective interest rates to morethan 40 percent a year last month has stopped the economy in itstracks.The sudden drain of confidence, vividly illustrated by thesteady exit of $30 billion in foreign reserves since Russia'scollapse last month, raised doubts about the direction of theeconomy that Brazilians once thought was doing well.Nilton Bonder, a rabbi and the writer of ``The Kabbalah ofMoney,'' said he felt as if Brazil had been seduced byglobalization as a first-world nation and had lowered tradebarriers without any strategy to modernize industry.As a result, Bonder noted, some companies in once formidableindustries like textiles and toys have slowed production and begunimporting from China, ``doing what's best for the company ratherthan what's best for Brazil.'' He said he could not imagine whatBrazil's long-term global role would be.Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, also questioned conventional economic wisdom, wonderinghow setting up a country like Brazil for recession, with a steepincrease in interest rates and cutbacks in government services,could be considered correct.``Structural reform is supposed to help the supply side of theeconomy, not be a precondition for increasing demand,'' Krugmanwrote recently. He likened the solutions for saving Japan, SouthKorea and other economies in crisis to ``trying to bail out asinking ship with teaspoons.''As the election approaches, Brazilians have hunkered down as iffor a tidal wave, expecting that the loss of employment, benefitsand government services, combined with the industrial slowdown,will hit them all at once after Sunday.Though nobody has laid out the details of Social Securitychanges, pensioners like Nilton Tambara, 54, a retired metalworker,fear becoming its targets.Cardoso had proposed that age rather than the number of yearsworked should determine eligibility for retirement. In a famousgaffe this year he used the word ``bums'' to describe workers whowanted to retire. Though Cardoso apologized for the remark, workerslike Tambara felt under attack.Tambara said he began working at 11 and paid into the SocialSecurity system for 33 of the 41 years that he had worked beforestarting to collect his pension. He said Brazilian men, on average,lived to 65.Although Brazil is the ninth-largest economy in the world,one-quarter of the adults live on one minimum salary of $110 amonth. Seven of 10 Brazilians who will vote next week have had lessthan a primary-level education.The distribution of income, among the most skewed in the world,continues in retirement, when 15 percent of those who collectSocial Security receive 50 percent of the benefits.``Is there any way to stay calm in this country?'' Tambaraasked. ``The categories that the government talks about _ the rich,the middle class and the poor _ don't exist. It's just the rich andthe miserable.''(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nn
