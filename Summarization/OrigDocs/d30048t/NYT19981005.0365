 
   WASHINGTON _ Increasingly angry at what they consider the
lenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailout
by the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials and
economists warned Monday that the programs being offered to protect
their own countries were too paltry.
 
 
   Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and former
finance minister, said that faced with the mounting financial
pressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world,
the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fund
in extra lending money would be adequate ``if things go well, but
not enough for a bad scenario.''
 
 
   By some calculations, he said, the developing world might need
$200 billion in new loans by 1999.
 
 
   Ortiz's warnings came at a seminar here during this year's
annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF. When Russia defaulted
in August on its huge foreign debts and the United States and other
major powers allowed it to happen, he said, South America's ability
to withstand the global financial crisis was seriously undermined.
 
 
   ``Until then we were doing fine,'' he said. ``But everything
changed after Russia.''
 
 
   What clearly angered Ortiz and other officials at the seminar
was the strong political and financial backing that the United
States and other major powers gave Russia right up to the moment it
defaulted.
 
 
   ``Russia was treated like a member of the Group of Seven,''
Ortiz said, referring to the world's most powerful nations, at
whose behest the monetary fund lent Russia $17 billion. ``It was
unthinkable it could fail,'' he said.
 
 
   He added that while Mexico could survive ``a period of market
instability, it must be temporary or the situation will be out of
control.''
 
 
   Ortiz said Russia's default made investors around the world wary
of all emerging market countries, including those in Latin America.
 
 
   Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile said: ``It's the
packaging effect. Analysts don't differentiate between regions,
countries or sectors anymore.''
 
 
   ``Latin America is being buffeted by external shocks this time,
it is not the source of the shocks,'' said E. Gerald Corrigan of
Goldman Sachs and a former president of the New York Federal
Reserve, alluding to the Mexican peso's collapse in 1995 and the
financial turmoil that it provoked.
 
 
   All ministers and officials speaking at the seminar, entitled
``Latin America: a steady ship in troubled waters?'' promised that
their countries would continue the free-market-oriented economic
reforms they have introduced in recent years, selling off
state-owned companies and encouraging private business.
 
 
   But they also insisted that the United States, other important
nations and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF must be
ready to help.
 
 
   The Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Malan, who was greeted
with cheers when he announced the apparent re-election of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged the government to impose painful
new austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit. ``We interpret
the election as a mandate to do what we said we would do,'' he
added.
 
 
   He recalled that early in September the finance ministers and
central bank governors of nine Latin American countries had met
with World Bank and IMF officials in Washington and vowed ``to
deepen our reform efforts.''
 
 
   In Brazil, consequently, there would be no changes in the
government's exchange rate policy and no resort to controls on
outflows of money even though the country has seen about $30
billion of its reserves drain away since July.
 
 
   But he said nothing about the big financial aid package he is
rumored to be negotiating with Washington, the World Bank and the
IMF and which some officials now say could total as much as $60
billion.
 
 
   He did evoke the possibility of a serious breakdown in Latin
America's largest economy _ which is bigger than those of South
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand combined _ by saying the world now has
``an historic opportunity to show how by acting together we could
have a successful experience at crisis prevention.''
 
 
   So far, Latin American economies have weathered the
international crisis relatively well. The IMF currently expects
them to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent
next year, down only 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent respectively on
what it predicted last May.
 
 
   But international confidence in the region's currencies is
vulnerable to the balance-of-payments deficits that all major Latin
American countries are running. They currently range from 3.6
percent and 4.4 percent of total output respectively for Brazil and
Argentina, to 7 percent in the case of Chile.
