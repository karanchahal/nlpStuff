WASHINGTON _ Increasingly angry at what they consider thelenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailoutby the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials andeconomists warned Monday that the programs being offered to protecttheir own countries were too paltry.Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and formerfinance minister, said that faced with the mounting financialpressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world,the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fundin extra lending money would be adequate ``if things go well, butnot enough for a bad scenario.''By some calculations, he said, the developing world might need$200 billion in new loans by 1999.Ortiz's warnings came at a seminar here during this year'sannual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF. When Russia defaultedin August on its huge foreign debts and the United States and othermajor powers allowed it to happen, he said, South America's abilityto withstand the global financial crisis was seriously undermined.``Until then we were doing fine,'' he said. ``But everythingchanged after Russia.''What clearly angered Ortiz and other officials at the seminarwas the strong political and financial backing that the UnitedStates and other major powers gave Russia right up to the moment itdefaulted.``Russia was treated like a member of the Group of Seven,''Ortiz said, referring to the world's most powerful nations, atwhose behest the monetary fund lent Russia $17 billion. ``It wasunthinkable it could fail,'' he said.He added that while Mexico could survive ``a period of marketinstability, it must be temporary or the situation will be out ofcontrol.''Ortiz said Russia's default made investors around the world waryof all emerging market countries, including those in Latin America.Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile said: ``It's thepackaging effect. Analysts don't differentiate between regions,countries or sectors anymore.''``Latin America is being buffeted by external shocks this time,it is not the source of the shocks,'' said E. Gerald Corrigan ofGoldman Sachs and a former president of the New York FederalReserve, alluding to the Mexican peso's collapse in 1995 and thefinancial turmoil that it provoked.All ministers and officials speaking at the seminar, entitled``Latin America: a steady ship in troubled waters?'' promised thattheir countries would continue the free-market-oriented economicreforms they have introduced in recent years, selling offstate-owned companies and encouraging private business.But they also insisted that the United States, other importantnations and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF must beready to help.The Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Malan, who was greetedwith cheers when he announced the apparent re-election of PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged the government to impose painfulnew austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit. ``We interpretthe election as a mandate to do what we said we would do,'' headded.He recalled that early in September the finance ministers andcentral bank governors of nine Latin American countries had metwith World Bank and IMF officials in Washington and vowed ``todeepen our reform efforts.''In Brazil, consequently, there would be no changes in thegovernment's exchange rate policy and no resort to controls onoutflows of money even though the country has seen about $30billion of its reserves drain away since July.But he said nothing about the big financial aid package he isrumored to be negotiating with Washington, the World Bank and theIMF and which some officials now say could total as much as $60billion.He did evoke the possibility of a serious breakdown in LatinAmerica's largest economy _ which is bigger than those of SouthKorea, Malaysia and Thailand combined _ by saying the world now has``an historic opportunity to show how by acting together we couldhave a successful experience at crisis prevention.''So far, Latin American economies have weathered theinternational crisis relatively well. The IMF currently expectsthem to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percentnext year, down only 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent respectively onwhat it predicted last May.But international confidence in the region's currencies isvulnerable to the balance-of-payments deficits that all major LatinAmerican countries are running. They currently range from 3.6percent and 4.4 percent of total output respectively for Brazil andArgentina, to 7 percent in the case of Chile.&QL;
