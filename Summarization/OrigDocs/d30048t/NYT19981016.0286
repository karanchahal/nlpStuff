BRASILIA, Brazil _ As a three-man economic team headed forWashington, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew off toPortugal, Brazilian government officials put the finishing touchesFriday on an ambitious package to raise $20 billion in revenuesthrough spending cuts and tax increases next year.But public announcement of those measures, eagerly awaited byinvestors and markets throughout Latin America, appear set fordelay once again. Details of Brazil's plans to reduce its highdeficits, initially expected to be announced just after Cardoso'sOct. 5 re-election, and then on Oct. 20, now will likely not bedisclosed before the second round of gubernatorial elections Oct.25, legislators said.Since the economic collapse of Russia in August, investors andeconomists have sharpened their focus on Brazil. While PresidentClinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock theInternational Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assistingBrazil, the team that returned here from the IMF's annual meetingin Washington earlier this month scoured government accounts forpolitically feasible sources of savings and reform.Though the country has sped up various receipts the governmentis getting for privatizing state entities like the phone system toreplenish foreign reserves, it is losing more than $400 million aday from central bank coffers. Foreign reserves, which had stood at$70 billion, are down to $46 billion, with capital flightsurpassing $30 billion despite the government's doubling ofinterest rates to more than 40 percent.Three senior government officials, Pedro Parente and Amaury Bierof the Finance Ministry and Altamir Lopes of the central bank, arescheduled to meet this weekend with IMF officials in Washington todiscuss the government's blueprint for cutbacks and reforms.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Eager to avoid replaying the contentious and unpopular IMFaccords of the 1980s, Brazilian officials are trying todisassociate the hardship to come from the IMF. The steps to cutthe budget deficit are being portrayed as measures to rehabilitatethe economic systems. In that way, the administration here hopes toavoid the humiliation of appearing to bend economic policy to IMForders once again.The IMF goal corresponds to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent surplusin Brazil's primary budget account, which covers governmentexpenses but excludes interest payments on debt. ``It will bedrastic, but we have to deliver that,'' said Demosthenes Madureirodo Pinho, the director of international relations at the Braziliancentral bank. Higher interest rates on the national debt arebringing the cost of the debt to 3.5 percent of Brazil's economy,Pinho said, adding that spending reforms are key to restoringconfidence and, ultimately, lowering interest rates.In August, before Russia's economic collapse triggered a swiftand sizable flight of capital from Brazil, the government hadpresented a budget for next year with a primary account surplus of0.92 percent, or $6 billion.A senior official at the Planning Ministry, Martus Tavares, saysthere is little room for the federal government to reduce itsbudget by much more. So the government will depend on tax increasesand savings by states and municipalities to raise the remaining $14billion.The federal government will likely create new taxes, increaseexisting ones and consolidate others to raise more revenues, thougheconomists warn that an expected deepening of the recession inBrazil bodes ill for tax revenues. Michel Temer, president of thelower house of Parliament, said in an interview here that Congresswould begin debate on social security reform Nov. 4, and wouldbegin what promises to be a stormy debate on political reform soonafter.The measures being discussed include a 0.1 percent increase on aspecial government tax on every check written, to 0.3 percent.Congress passed the tax in 1996 as a one-year effort to improve thedeteriorating public health system, but the revenue has been usedto offset excess spending in other areas. Last year, the taxbrought in $7 billion. With a 0.1 percent increase, it will likelybring in another $3 billion, and it would be made permanent.The three-year plan of adjustments also relies on states andmunicipalities to produce about 30 percent of the projected savingsthrough legally-mandated spending limits, though states have had aspotty record in controlling outlays.While Cardoso clearly interpreted his victory this month as amandate for swift, if painful, reforms, it is by no means clearthat state governors are hearing the same message from voters. Ingubernatorial races in key Brazilian states, Brazilians arefavoring candidates that are not particularly known for austerity.
