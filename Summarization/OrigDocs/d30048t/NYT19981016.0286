 
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ As a three-man economic team headed for
Washington, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso flew off to
Portugal, Brazilian government officials put the finishing touches
Friday on an ambitious package to raise $20 billion in revenues
through spending cuts and tax increases next year.
 
 
   But public announcement of those measures, eagerly awaited by
investors and markets throughout Latin America, appear set for
delay once again. Details of Brazil's plans to reduce its high
deficits, initially expected to be announced just after Cardoso's
Oct. 5 re-election, and then on Oct. 20, now will likely not be
disclosed before the second round of gubernatorial elections Oct.
25, legislators said.
 
 
   Since the economic collapse of Russia in August, investors and
economists have sharpened their focus on Brazil. While President
Clinton lobbied Congress for $18 billion to restock the
International Monetary Fund this week, with an eye toward assisting
Brazil, the team that returned here from the IMF's annual meeting
in Washington earlier this month scoured government accounts for
politically feasible sources of savings and reform.
 
 
   Though the country has sped up various receipts the government
is getting for privatizing state entities like the phone system to
replenish foreign reserves, it is losing more than $400 million a
day from central bank coffers. Foreign reserves, which had stood at
$70 billion, are down to $46 billion, with capital flight
surpassing $30 billion despite the government's doubling of
interest rates to more than 40 percent.
 
 
   Three senior government officials, Pedro Parente and Amaury Bier
of the Finance Ministry and Altamir Lopes of the central bank, are
scheduled to meet this weekend with IMF officials in Washington to
discuss the government's blueprint for cutbacks and reforms.
 
 
   Eager to avoid replaying the contentious and unpopular IMF
accords of the 1980s, Brazilian officials are trying to
disassociate the hardship to come from the IMF. The steps to cut
the budget deficit are being portrayed as measures to rehabilitate
the economic systems. In that way, the administration here hopes to
avoid the humiliation of appearing to bend economic policy to IMF
orders once again.
 
 
   The IMF goal corresponds to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent surplus
in Brazil's primary budget account, which covers government
expenses but excludes interest payments on debt. ``It will be
drastic, but we have to deliver that,'' said Demosthenes Madureiro
do Pinho, the director of international relations at the Brazilian
central bank. Higher interest rates on the national debt are
bringing the cost of the debt to 3.5 percent of Brazil's economy,
Pinho said, adding that spending reforms are key to restoring
confidence and, ultimately, lowering interest rates.
 
 
   In August, before Russia's economic collapse triggered a swift
and sizable flight of capital from Brazil, the government had
presented a budget for next year with a primary account surplus of
0.92 percent, or $6 billion.
 
 
   A senior official at the Planning Ministry, Martus Tavares, says
there is little room for the federal government to reduce its
budget by much more. So the government will depend on tax increases
and savings by states and municipalities to raise the remaining $14
billion.
 
 
   The federal government will likely create new taxes, increase
existing ones and consolidate others to raise more revenues, though
economists warn that an expected deepening of the recession in
Brazil bodes ill for tax revenues. Michel Temer, president of the
lower house of Parliament, said in an interview here that Congress
would begin debate on social security reform Nov. 4, and would
begin what promises to be a stormy debate on political reform soon
after.
 
 
   The measures being discussed include a 0.1 percent increase on a
special government tax on every check written, to 0.3 percent.
Congress passed the tax in 1996 as a one-year effort to improve the
deteriorating public health system, but the revenue has been used
to offset excess spending in other areas. Last year, the tax
brought in $7 billion. With a 0.1 percent increase, it will likely
bring in another $3 billion, and it would be made permanent.
 
 
   The three-year plan of adjustments also relies on states and
municipalities to produce about 30 percent of the projected savings
through legally-mandated spending limits, though states have had a
spotty record in controlling outlays.
 
 
   While Cardoso clearly interpreted his victory this month as a
mandate for swift, if painful, reforms, it is by no means clear
that state governors are hearing the same message from voters. In
gubernatorial races in key Brazilian states, Brazilians are
favoring candidates that are not particularly known for austerity.
