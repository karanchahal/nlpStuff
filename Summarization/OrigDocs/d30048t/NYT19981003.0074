WASHINGTON _ As financial leaders from the world's majoreconomies, as well as from many of the most shell-shocked, gatheredSaturday for talks, the Clinton administration faced unusualchallenges from Europe, Japan and emerging-market nations, whichare all arriving with different and even contradictory strategiesfor stabilizing the global economy.The clash of approaches, which began to play out as TreasurySecretary Robert Rubin sat down Saturday morning with Japan'sfinance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, reflects both the extraordinarytension and the behind-the-scenes power struggles under way as theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank open their annualmeeting here.After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bankfailures and bankruptcies around the globe, governments aresearching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach thatcan halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half acentury.But it will not be easy, officials concede. As the meetingsopened, Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aidstricken countries throughout Asia. The program includes governmentloans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian nations and guaranteesthat private bank loans will be repaid.While Southeast Asian countries immediately hailed the move, theClinton administration's response was lukewarm. Rubin had said onFriday, even before the announcement, that Japan's action was``constructive,'' but that getting its own banks in order and itshuge economy restarted was ``by vast multiples more important.''Miyazawa, a former prime minister who has 40 years of experiencedealing with the United States, shot back Saturday that PresidentClinton's proposals for new strategies on how the IMF could chokeoff crises before they start ``would not be very convincing unlessthe United States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to.''He was referring to Congress' refusal so far to approve $18billion in new money for the fund, an issue that Senate and Houseconferees will be debating as the meetings go on here this week.President Clinton will take the unusual step of participatingdirectly on Monday in a critical meeting of finance ministers andcentral bankers from 22 nations. And on Tuesday he will speak tothe entire IMF, which represents 182 nations, in his second majorspeech on the world economy in three weeks.Clinton set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday, when hedeclared that the world was on a ``financial precipice.'' ButClinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become farmore publicly involved in managing the world's financial chaos,insisted that it was not too late to act.``We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of usthat enjoy growth will take the initiative and move now,'' he saidat the White House.A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may comewithin days as the IMF, the Treasury Department and Brazil'sfinance minister, Pedro Malan, put the final touches on a packageof $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.Rubin met with Malan at the Treasury late on Friday, and therewas considerable speculation that the package could be announced assoon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's presidentialelection. The vote is expected to result in the re-election ofPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso.Clinton administration officials say they fear that a financialmeltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America with it,and bring the crisis to the United States' own borders.Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that itwill be extraordinarily difficult to get nations facing a variedarray of problems _ deep recession and mass unemployment inSoutheast Asia, political paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, hugebank failures in Japan, an incipient currency crisis in Brazil, butcontinued prosperity in Western Europe and the United States _ tosettle on a common agenda.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnThe United States, for example, is insisting that there be nobacking away from a decade-long move toward freer and more openfinancial markets around the world.But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about``capital controls'' that would reimpose government regulationpreventing investors from moving billions in short-term investmentsfrom one country to another with a few taps on the computerkeyboard.The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of thecommittee that oversees the IMF, while Russia is threatening todefault on its loans unless it is quickly given billions that thefund suspended when President Boris Yeltsin fired his team ofeconomic reformers and violated the terms of his accord for Westernaid.A senior IMF official said last month that Russia's threats are``a form of blackmail, but the enormous turbulence touched off bythe Russian financial debacle in September gives real teeth toRussia's threats.Clinton and Rubin are hoping to craft their own strategies tocalm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of therecession from hitting U.S. shores, where exports and corporateprofits are already badly affected.The most immediate of those strategies would allow the IMF tolaunch pre-emptive strikes to bolster the finances of fundamentallyhealthy economies where the global economic contagion seems likelyto hit next.Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aidonly after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing. But by thattime, the country's currency is already under heavy attack, andputting together a bailout can cost far more and often involvesausterity measures _ from budget cuts to sky-high interest rates _that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.The administration's proposal will first be debated by the Groupof Seven industrial nations and then, if it gathers much support,by a larger meeting of 22 nations, including most of the majoremerging markets.But a senior Japanese official noted Saturday that thepresident's plan ``seems aimed mostly at Latin America'' andprobably would ``not meet a lot of enthusiasm in Europe and Asia.''Meanwhile the Europeans are debating how to respond to callsfrom Washington for a lowering of interest rates, a step Japan andthe United States have already taken _ though with the most modestof reductions.Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, hinted late in theweek before last that London may follow suit. But Germany,traditionally far more concerned about inflation, has declined tofollow suit. The German government is playing an unusually smallrole here as its incoming chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, preparesto assemble an economic team.The Southeast Asian nations _ which only five years ago were thesubject of a much-discussed World Bank study called ``The EastAsian Miracle'' _ arrived here in shock and confusion about what todo next. The first nation to be hit by trouble, Thailand, is miredin difficulties, but looks good in comparison with most of theregion's other nations.Malaysia is suffering economic turmoil, and Indonesia's economyis plunging so deeply into recession that the IMF is backing awayfrom many of its demands on its government.``In my country,'' said one Indonesian during aquestion-and-answer period at the opening session of the meetingshere, ``IMF means I'm Finished.''
