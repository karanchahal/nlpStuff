   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters gave President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of
balloting Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a
country struggling against economic crisis.
 
 
   With 22 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have
won 51 percent of the vote, compared with 34 percent for his main
rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential
candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
 
 
   If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardoso
will be declared re-elected without facing a runoff. Exit polls
indicated that he might win as much as 56 percent.
 
 
   Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia
Sunday night called the vote a mandate for the economic measures
that the president is under national and international pressure to
carry out.
 
 
   With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since
Russia's economic collapse in late August, and with the Sao Paulo
stock market down more than 40 percent this year, the Brazilian
government has been close to paralyzed by the approach of the
election.
 
 
   It has been negotiating a bailout with the International
Monetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structural
changes that would cut government expenses over the long term.
 
 
   The waiting is probably not over yet, though. The size of his
victory strengthens Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive
social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead. But
political analysts said Congress would probably not convene to
consider the painful economic measures before important
gubernatorial runoffs on Oct. 25 because the legislators will be
busy campaigning for their parties' gubernatorial candidates.
 
 
   With policy-makers at meetings of the Group of Seven industrial
nations and the International Monetary Fund in Washington seeking
permanent solutions to ward off the volatility that is threatening
Brazil after devastating Asia and Russia, Cardoso is under
considerable pressure to put Brazil's accounts in order.
 
 
   But Gregg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities in New York, said the international financial markets
were not necessarily expecting major changes from Brazil in the
next few weeks.
 
 
   ``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether
there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, and
whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they're
moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial
markets.''
 
 
   Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at
Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro and chief of population
studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics,
said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress toward
restructuring the government before Oct. 25, because such measures
would require legislative approval.
 
 
   ``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to
cut costs or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.
 
 
   Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half of the
country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters
had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end
before polls opened Sunday, most candidates appeared to ignore the
prohibition.
 
 
   At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum
in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-size photos of
candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and
carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to cast their
votes, with many supporting Cardoso.
 
 
   Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha,
said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because the president
had ended inflation. ``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy
whatever you need now,'' Silveira said. ``Four years is not enough
to change a country as big as ours. I really believe in him.''
 
 
   Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote
for Cardoso. For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a
lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. Her father dreamed of
giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms. Oliveira said, but he
died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.
 
 
   ``Now the house is almost done,'' she said. ``It's almost
completely in order.''
 
 
   Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments
ahead, though the president announced less than two weeks before
the election that government belt-tightening measures would be
inevitable. Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote Sunday,
nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school education,
and 35 percent are barely literate.
 
 
   Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said
that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally
but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's
economy. The president said he would cut government costs, crack
down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase
revenues.
 
 
   ``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of
myself,'' da Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will
get better.''
