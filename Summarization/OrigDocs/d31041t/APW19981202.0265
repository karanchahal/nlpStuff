HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it hadpulled out of talks to buy a stake in ailing Philippine Airlines _making the uncertain future at PAL even cloudier.Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he would try to coaxthe two sides back together, but it was unclear whether Cathay wasout of the picture for good.``There is now a real risk of PAL going bust, and this time forreal,'' said airline analyst John Hetherington of Paribas AsiaEquity Ltd. ``PAL is back in the unfortunate position of finding anew suitor.''But another industry expert suggested the talks between HongKong's flag carrier and PAL might still be ``pretty fluid.''``This game has been going on for quite a while,'' said airlineanalyst Peter Tang at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.Cathay said it had withdrawn its bid to pour up to U.S. dlrs 100million into debt-ridden PAL because of ``certain issues whichcould not be resolved,'' according to a statement from companysecretary P.A. Moore.Moore would not elaborate on the stumbling blocks. ButPhilippine officials said Cathay and PAL had run into difficultiesin two areas: who would manage PAL and how many workers would losetheir jobs.Cathay executives did not immediately return a reporter'stelephone inquiries about whether they would consider fresh talkswith PAL. Cathay shares were little changed in trading Wednesday'son the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Estrada appeared unwilling to give up on PAL, which stoppedflying in a labor dispute in September but soon got back into theair.``As much as PAL is the flag carrier, we should see to it thatPAL will always fly. If PAL will close down, so many businesseswill be affected,'' Estrada said.Meanwhile, PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said thecarrier has been developing contingency plans to return tofinancial health without help from other airlines.``It isn't a cause for concern,'' he told Dow Jones Newswires.PAL will submit a plan to the Philippine Securities and ExchangeCommission by Dec. 7, the carrier's deadline for finding a way tomake good on some U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debts that now are goingunpaid, Aquino said.Early Wednesday, Cathay had expressed dissatisfaction over thetalks with PAL, saying it was ``not willing to continuenegotiations with PAL in its current form.''``We're very sad. We tried very hard to make it work,'' PeterFoster, Cathay's regional manager for the Philippines and Taiwan,told The Associated Press. Foster said the negotiations have beengoing on for six weeks.PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from CathayPacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would drawup a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, earlier saidPAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, had gone to theUnited States to try to resume negotiations with NorthwestAirlines, one of PAL's prospective investors.PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing topersuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recoveryplan under which their collective bargaining agreement would besuspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of thecompany.The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL toresume domestic and international flights in early October.PAL says it is unable to pay all its debts due to mountinglosses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
