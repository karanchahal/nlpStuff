	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it had
pulled out of talks to buy a stake in ailing Philippine Airlines _
making the uncertain future at PAL even cloudier.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he would try to coax
the two sides back together, but it was unclear whether Cathay was
out of the picture for good.
	   ``There is now a real risk of PAL going bust, and this time for
real,'' said airline analyst John Hetherington of Paribas Asia
Equity Ltd. ``PAL is back in the unfortunate position of finding a
new suitor.''
	   But another industry expert suggested the talks between Hong
Kong's flag carrier and PAL might still be ``pretty fluid.''
	   ``This game has been going on for quite a while,'' said airline
analyst Peter Tang at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.
	   Cathay said it had withdrawn its bid to pour up to U.S. dlrs 100
million into debt-ridden PAL because of ``certain issues which
could not be resolved,'' according to a statement from company
secretary P.A. Moore.
	   Moore would not elaborate on the stumbling blocks. But
Philippine officials said Cathay and PAL had run into difficulties
in two areas: who would manage PAL and how many workers would lose
their jobs.
	   Cathay executives did not immediately return a reporter's
telephone inquiries about whether they would consider fresh talks
with PAL. Cathay shares were little changed in trading Wednesday's
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
	   Estrada appeared unwilling to give up on PAL, which stopped
flying in a labor dispute in September but soon got back into the
air.
	   ``As much as PAL is the flag carrier, we should see to it that
PAL will always fly. If PAL will close down, so many businesses
will be affected,'' Estrada said.
	   Meanwhile, PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said the
carrier has been developing contingency plans to return to
financial health without help from other airlines.
	   ``It isn't a cause for concern,'' he told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   PAL will submit a plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission by Dec. 7, the carrier's deadline for finding a way to
make good on some U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debts that now are going
unpaid, Aquino said.
	   Early Wednesday, Cathay had expressed dissatisfaction over the
talks with PAL, saying it was ``not willing to continue
negotiations with PAL in its current form.''
	   ``We're very sad. We tried very hard to make it work,'' Peter
Foster, Cathay's regional manager for the Philippines and Taiwan,
told The Associated Press. Foster said the negotiations have been
going on for six weeks.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
	   Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, earlier said
PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, had gone to the
United States to try to resume negotiations with Northwest
Airlines, one of PAL's prospective investors.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic and international flights in early October.
	   PAL says it is unable to pay all its debts due to mounting
losses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.
