	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Prospective investor Cathay Pacific
Airways wants the number of employees at troubled Philippine
Airlines to be slashed from more than 8,000 to 5,000 but PAL has
not yet agreed, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Monday.
	   PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from the Hong
Kong-based carrier and the two companies are drawing up a
comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
	   PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, wants to retain
about 8,000 employees to avoid antagonizing the airline's labor
unions, Espiritu said.
	   ``That is the point of disagreement now because Cathay wants a
larger retrenchment,'' Espiritu told reporters.
	   Cathay Pacific officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Espiritu said Cathay Pacific may invest as much as dlrs 100
million in PAL but other foreign investors, including the
International Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment arm, are
interested in investing part of that amount.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.
