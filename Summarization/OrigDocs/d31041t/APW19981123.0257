MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Prospective investor Cathay PacificAirways wants the number of employees at troubled PhilippineAirlines to be slashed from more than 8,000 to 5,000 but PAL hasnot yet agreed, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Monday.PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from the HongKong-based carrier and the two companies are drawing up acomprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, wants to retainabout 8,000 employees to avoid antagonizing the airline's laborunions, Espiritu said.``That is the point of disagreement now because Cathay wants alarger retrenchment,'' Espiritu told reporters.Cathay Pacific officials were not immediately available forcomment.Espiritu said Cathay Pacific may invest as much as dlrs 100million in PAL but other foreign investors, including theInternational Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment arm, areinterested in investing part of that amount.PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing topersuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recoveryplan under which its collective bargaining agreement would besuspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of thecompany's stock.The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL toresume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecifiednumber of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workersget separation benefits agreed by both sides.In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At theheight of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers tominimize its losses.PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion ofdebt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems andAsia's currency crisis.
