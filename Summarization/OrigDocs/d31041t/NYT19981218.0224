 
   MANILA, Philippines _ Christmas is a sacred holiday in the
Philippines, and nowhere is that more evident than at the
headquarters of Philippine Airlines. Religious statues adorn
executive offices, and signs throughout the building announce a
holiday mass in the main lobby.
 
 
   In these dark days, when its frazzled executives are struggling
to keep the airline afloat, a mass seems entirely appropriate: One
cannot help thinking that what the airline needs is divine
intervention.
 
 
   With $2.2 billion in debt, plunging revenues, and losses of
close to $1 million a day, Asia's oldest airline, known as PAL, is
in desperate shape. When negotiations for Cathay Pacific Airways to
acquire a stake collapsed earlier this month, several analysts said
the airline's options were running out.
 
 
   ``The rescue effort is not just huge, it is astronomical,'' said
Nicholas Ionides, a Singapore-based editor of Air Transport
Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry. ``The
question is, Do you keep an airline like this alive for pride
reasons? My opinion is that they should just shut it down.''
 
 
   But Philippine Airlines is not just another shipwreck of a
company. It is the nation's flag carrier, a state company until
after the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos, when it was spun off to a
group of investors led by Lucio Tan, an ethnic Chinese who traded
on his ties to Marcos to amass one of the greatest fortunes in the
Philippines. The airline is now the crown jewel in Tan's empire.
 
 
   Tan is a leading supporter of the new president of the
Philippines, Joseph Estrada, not only contributing to his campaign
but giving him the use of his planes. When a labor dispute prompted
Tan to shut down the 57-year-old airline in September, provoking
tears from nostalgic Filipinos, it was Estrada who brokered an
agreement that got the planes flying again.
 
 
   ``For Estrada, it's a mark of political prestige to save the
airline, and Lucio Tan knows it,'' said Alexander Magno, president
of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, a research organization in
Manila.
 
 
   In the murky world of Asian business, where friendships often
count more than solvency, Philippine Airlines would seem to be the
classic candidate for a government bailout. The catch is that
Estrada, wanting foreign investors to view the Philippines as
having a level playing field, has ruled out injecting any public
money.
 
 
   As the losses pile up, though, Philippine Airlines will be an
acid test for this movie-star-turned-politician, who has been in
office for six months. Estrada, 61, may find it hard not to help a
friend in need, even if it reinforces the image of the Philippines
as a den of crony capitalism.
 
 
   ``It's going to be very tough for Estrada,'' said Christian
Monzad, former chairman of the Philippine Election Commission and a
consultant to the Lopez Group, a Filipino conglomerate. ``He is
very loyal to his friends, and he would like to repay his political
debts.''
 
 
   Estrada's decision will be watched carefully in other Asian
capitals, which are grappling with similar issues. In Indonesia,
the government has refused to aid companies with ties to its fallen
president, Suharto. But in Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has continued to pump public money into private companies.
 
 
   In the spartan offices of Philippine Airlines, senior executives
insist they can go it alone. On Dec. 7, they submitted a
rehabilitation plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission that would turn PAL from a sprawling national airline
into a compact carrier focused on profitable routes.
 
 
   The airline said it would prune its fleet, which was
aggressively expanded in the years leading up to the Asian economic
crisis, to 22 planes from 57. It would cut its domestic routes to
17 from 36 and its international routes to 13 from 26; among the
routes lost would be those to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
 
 
   The loss of routes has eroded some fond traditions here.
Philippine Airlines used to ferry home for the holidays scores of
Filipinos who work abroad _ often at cut-rate fares it can no
longer afford. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of Filipinos from
North America streamed into Manila via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific.
 
 
   ``I think we have a very good chance of rehabilitating this
airline, although we need the support of the major stakeholders,''
said Jaime Bautista, chief financial officer of Philippine
Airlines.
 
 
   The trouble is, the finances do not add up. The airline says it
needs $150 million in fresh capital to overhaul its operations and
begin paying off its debt. Tan and other shareholders will come up
with $90 million, and the rest would come from new investors.
 
 
   After the collapse of the talks with Cathay Pacific, analysts
said they doubted that Philippine Airlines would find a white
knight. Bautista conceded that the carrier was not talking to any
other airlines, though he has retained Chase Manhattan Bank to
scour the world for potential partners.
 
 
   In the meantime, Bautista said, he saw nothing wrong with the
government throwing the airline a few favors.
 
 
   ``A national flag carrier is very important to a country,'' said
Bautista, an amiable man whose punishing work schedule has made him
look a good deal older than his 41 years. ``Governments have always
been there to help.''
 
 
   Tan declined to be interviewed. But Bautista said the airline
deserved help because his boss had been treated unfairly by the
government. In truth, Tan's experience is more a case of ending up
on the wrong side of history. Under the Marcos regime, he made a
fortune in the cigarette and beer businesses _ in no small part
through government tax breaks.
 
 
   But after Marcos was ousted in 1986, Tan got a chillier
reception from his successors, Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos. The
now 64-year-old tycoon was hit with a $1 billion tax-evasion
lawsuit that was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court in 1996.
And he no longer enjoyed preferential treatment.
 
 
   None of this stopped Tan from adding to his empire. He first
invested in Philippine Airlines in 1992 and won control in 1996.
But Ramos, who was intent on privatizing the economy, opened the
industry to competition, licensing rivals like Air Philippines,
Cebu Pacific and Grand Air.
 
 
   Bautista said the new airlines competed with Philippine Airlines
on profitable routes, like flights to the resort island of Cebu.
But the government required the airline to continue serving
money-losing ``missionary routes'' _ outposts in this vast
archipelago where the planes often fly empty.
 
 
   Bautista said the government also allowed foreign carriers to
increase flights to Manila, enabling them to undercut PAL's fares.
Last week the airline asked the Estrada administration to cut back
the flights open to foreign carriers to pre-Ramos levels.
 
 
   Edgardo Espiritu, the finance secretary, said the government
would probably grant the request to reverse the ``unhealthy
actions'' of the previous administration.
 
 
   Magno of the Foundation for Economic Freedom said these
protections ``would restore PAL to monopoly status.''
 
 
   The government is not stopping there. Espiritu has asked several
government-affiliated banks to make bridge loans to Philippine
Airlines. The president of the Philippine National Bank, which is
already owed $81 million by the airline, has resisted the idea. But
the government is the bank's largest shareholder, with a 45 percent
stake, so he may have little choice.
 
 
 
   Still, it is not clear that cash alone will solve the problem.
Analysts said Philippine Airlines was being choked by a bloated
payroll. The airline has trimmed its ranks from 12,986 employees to
8,589 since May. But industry experts said it would have to cut
that to 2,000 to compete with more efficient carriers like Cathay
Pacific or Singapore Airlines.
 
 
   ``When you've got too many employees sitting around, they get
into other problems _ they go on strike, they organize unions,''
said Jim Eckes, an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong
Kong.
 
 
   Indeed, a strike by employees precipitated the airline's
near-death experience in September, when Tan shut down the carrier
after its unions refused to accept a drastic cost-cutting plan.
After two weeks of frantic mediation by Estrada, the unions voted
to give up a collective-bargaining agreement in return for a 20
percent stake in the airline and three board seats.
 
 
   The agreement gave Tan some breathing room to cut the payroll.
But Eckes said it would be politically untenable to trim enough
workers to make it genuinely competitive. And hacking away at costs
does not erase the carrier's debt load, which, at $2.2 billion, is
larger than its estimated break-up value of $1.6 billion.
 
 
   The airline's creditors _ which include local and foreign banks,
plus export-import banks in the United States and Europe _ must
approve the rescue plan. But short of a nasty battle over the
airline's planes, they do not have a better option.
 
 
   Two questions now hang over Philippine Airlines. The first is
whether it is really worth saving. Some analysts contend that other
carriers already serve the most critical domestic and international
routes, and that a new airline _ without PAL's baggage _ could soon
claim the mantle of flag carrier.
 
 
   ``If you are nonemotional about it, there is no loss,'' said
David Sherman, a consultant who specializes in transportation at
A.T. Kearney in Hong Kong. ``If you are emotional about it, this is
a tragedy.''
 
 
   The second question is: Can Philippine Airlines be saved with
Tan? In the negotiations with Cathay Pacific, he refused to
relinquish control, which ultimately doomed the talks. Bautista
said Tan was willing to hand over day-to-day operations but
insisted on retaining control of the board.
 
 
   Industry experts said no investor would put up money to revive
the airline unless it gained control. Perhaps the one person who
could ease Tan out of the cockpit is Estrada. But in an interview
last month, Estrada seemed more intent on praising Tan than on
prodding him.
 
 
   ``We have to admire Lucio Tan,'' he said, ``because in spite of
losing big money, I was able to prevail upon him to continue losing
money.''
 
 
   And how was the president able to do that?
 
 
   ``He has attained his goal as a billionaire,'' Estrada replied
solemnly. ``Maybe before he leaves the world, he wants to do
something for his country.''
