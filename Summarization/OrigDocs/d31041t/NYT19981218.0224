MANILA, Philippines _ Christmas is a sacred holiday in thePhilippines, and nowhere is that more evident than at theheadquarters of Philippine Airlines. Religious statues adornexecutive offices, and signs throughout the building announce aholiday mass in the main lobby.In these dark days, when its frazzled executives are strugglingto keep the airline afloat, a mass seems entirely appropriate: Onecannot help thinking that what the airline needs is divineintervention.With $2.2 billion in debt, plunging revenues, and losses ofclose to $1 million a day, Asia's oldest airline, known as PAL, isin desperate shape. When negotiations for Cathay Pacific Airways toacquire a stake collapsed earlier this month, several analysts saidthe airline's options were running out.``The rescue effort is not just huge, it is astronomical,'' saidNicholas Ionides, a Singapore-based editor of Air TransportIntelligence, a news agency that covers the industry. ``Thequestion is, Do you keep an airline like this alive for pridereasons? My opinion is that they should just shut it down.''But Philippine Airlines is not just another shipwreck of acompany. It is the nation's flag carrier, a state company untilafter the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos, when it was spun off to agroup of investors led by Lucio Tan, an ethnic Chinese who tradedon his ties to Marcos to amass one of the greatest fortunes in thePhilippines. The airline is now the crown jewel in Tan's empire.Tan is a leading supporter of the new president of thePhilippines, Joseph Estrada, not only contributing to his campaignbut giving him the use of his planes. When a labor dispute promptedTan to shut down the 57-year-old airline in September, provokingtears from nostalgic Filipinos, it was Estrada who brokered anagreement that got the planes flying again.``For Estrada, it's a mark of political prestige to save theairline, and Lucio Tan knows it,'' said Alexander Magno, presidentof the Foundation for Economic Freedom, a research organization inManila.In the murky world of Asian business, where friendships oftencount more than solvency, Philippine Airlines would seem to be theclassic candidate for a government bailout. The catch is thatEstrada, wanting foreign investors to view the Philippines ashaving a level playing field, has ruled out injecting any publicmoney.As the losses pile up, though, Philippine Airlines will be anacid test for this movie-star-turned-politician, who has been inoffice for six months. Estrada, 61, may find it hard not to help afriend in need, even if it reinforces the image of the Philippinesas a den of crony capitalism.``It's going to be very tough for Estrada,'' said ChristianMonzad, former chairman of the Philippine Election Commission and aconsultant to the Lopez Group, a Filipino conglomerate. ``He isvery loyal to his friends, and he would like to repay his politicaldebts.''Estrada's decision will be watched carefully in other Asiancapitals, which are grappling with similar issues. In Indonesia,the government has refused to aid companies with ties to its fallenpresident, Suharto. But in Malaysia, Prime Minister MahathirMohamad has continued to pump public money into private companies.In the spartan offices of Philippine Airlines, senior executivesinsist they can go it alone. On Dec. 7, they submitted arehabilitation plan to the Philippine Securities and ExchangeCommission that would turn PAL from a sprawling national airlineinto a compact carrier focused on profitable routes.The airline said it would prune its fleet, which wasaggressively expanded in the years leading up to the Asian economiccrisis, to 22 planes from 57. It would cut its domestic routes to17 from 36 and its international routes to 13 from 26; among theroutes lost would be those to Los Angeles and San Francisco.The loss of routes has eroded some fond traditions here.Philippine Airlines used to ferry home for the holidays scores ofFilipinos who work abroad _ often at cut-rate fares it can nolonger afford. On a recent afternoon, hundreds of Filipinos fromNorth America streamed into Manila via Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific.``I think we have a very good chance of rehabilitating thisairline, although we need the support of the major stakeholders,''said Jaime Bautista, chief financial officer of PhilippineAirlines.The trouble is, the finances do not add up. The airline says itneeds $150 million in fresh capital to overhaul its operations andbegin paying off its debt. Tan and other shareholders will come upwith $90 million, and the rest would come from new investors.After the collapse of the talks with Cathay Pacific, analystssaid they doubted that Philippine Airlines would find a whiteknight. Bautista conceded that the carrier was not talking to anyother airlines, though he has retained Chase Manhattan Bank toscour the world for potential partners.In the meantime, Bautista said, he saw nothing wrong with thegovernment throwing the airline a few favors.``A national flag carrier is very important to a country,'' saidBautista, an amiable man whose punishing work schedule has made himlook a good deal older than his 41 years. ``Governments have alwaysbeen there to help.''Tan declined to be interviewed. But Bautista said the airlinedeserved help because his boss had been treated unfairly by thegovernment. In truth, Tan's experience is more a case of ending upon the wrong side of history. Under the Marcos regime, he made afortune in the cigarette and beer businesses _ in no small partthrough government tax breaks.But after Marcos was ousted in 1986, Tan got a chillierreception from his successors, Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos. Thenow 64-year-old tycoon was hit with a $1 billion tax-evasionlawsuit that was finally dismissed by the Supreme Court in 1996.And he no longer enjoyed preferential treatment.None of this stopped Tan from adding to his empire. He firstinvested in Philippine Airlines in 1992 and won control in 1996.But Ramos, who was intent on privatizing the economy, opened theindustry to competition, licensing rivals like Air Philippines,Cebu Pacific and Grand Air.Bautista said the new airlines competed with Philippine Airlineson profitable routes, like flights to the resort island of Cebu.But the government required the airline to continue servingmoney-losing ``missionary routes'' _ outposts in this vastarchipelago where the planes often fly empty.Bautista said the government also allowed foreign carriers toincrease flights to Manila, enabling them to undercut PAL's fares.Last week the airline asked the Estrada administration to cut backthe flights open to foreign carriers to pre-Ramos levels.Edgardo Espiritu, the finance secretary, said the governmentwould probably grant the request to reverse the ``unhealthyactions'' of the previous administration.Magno of the Foundation for Economic Freedom said theseprotections ``would restore PAL to monopoly status.''The government is not stopping there. Espiritu has asked severalgovernment-affiliated banks to make bridge loans to PhilippineAirlines. The president of the Philippine National Bank, which isalready owed $81 million by the airline, has resisted the idea. Butthe government is the bank's largest shareholder, with a 45 percentstake, so he may have little choice.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnStill, it is not clear that cash alone will solve the problem.Analysts said Philippine Airlines was being choked by a bloatedpayroll. The airline has trimmed its ranks from 12,986 employees to8,589 since May. But industry experts said it would have to cutthat to 2,000 to compete with more efficient carriers like CathayPacific or Singapore Airlines.``When you've got too many employees sitting around, they getinto other problems _ they go on strike, they organize unions,''said Jim Eckes, an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in HongKong.Indeed, a strike by employees precipitated the airline'snear-death experience in September, when Tan shut down the carrierafter its unions refused to accept a drastic cost-cutting plan.After two weeks of frantic mediation by Estrada, the unions votedto give up a collective-bargaining agreement in return for a 20percent stake in the airline and three board seats.The agreement gave Tan some breathing room to cut the payroll.But Eckes said it would be politically untenable to trim enoughworkers to make it genuinely competitive. And hacking away at costsdoes not erase the carrier's debt load, which, at $2.2 billion, islarger than its estimated break-up value of $1.6 billion.The airline's creditors _ which include local and foreign banks,plus export-import banks in the United States and Europe _ mustapprove the rescue plan. But short of a nasty battle over theairline's planes, they do not have a better option.Two questions now hang over Philippine Airlines. The first iswhether it is really worth saving. Some analysts contend that othercarriers already serve the most critical domestic and internationalroutes, and that a new airline _ without PAL's baggage _ could soonclaim the mantle of flag carrier.``If you are nonemotional about it, there is no loss,'' saidDavid Sherman, a consultant who specializes in transportation atA.T. Kearney in Hong Kong. ``If you are emotional about it, this isa tragedy.''The second question is: Can Philippine Airlines be saved withTan? In the negotiations with Cathay Pacific, he refused torelinquish control, which ultimately doomed the talks. Bautistasaid Tan was willing to hand over day-to-day operations butinsisted on retaining control of the board.Industry experts said no investor would put up money to revivethe airline unless it gained control. Perhaps the one person whocould ease Tan out of the cockpit is Estrada. But in an interviewlast month, Estrada seemed more intent on praising Tan than onprodding him.``We have to admire Lucio Tan,'' he said, ``because in spite oflosing big money, I was able to prevail upon him to continue losingmoney.''And how was the president able to do that?``He has attained his goal as a billionaire,'' Estrada repliedsolemnly. ``Maybe before he leaves the world, he wants to dosomething for his country.''
