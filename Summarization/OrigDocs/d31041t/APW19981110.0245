	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is ready to
give up its stake in ailing Philippine Airlines and will not infuse
any additional capital if a new investor, possibly Cathay Pacific
Airways, comes in, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``Our objective is full privatization. The government's policy
is to be out of the company that is being privatized,'' Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   The government owns 14 percent of PAL, mostly held by public
financial institutions, pension funds and the defense forces.
	   PAL is negotiating with Cathay Pacific, which could buy up to 40
percent of the airline under Philippine law.
	   Cathay Pacific has said it wants management control of the
Philippine flag carrier, which has been mired in debt and labor
unrest. A PAL official has said it is willing to give Cathay
Pacific management control.
	   Several Manila newspapers reported Tuesday that Cathay Pacific
also is demanding that the government divest its shareholdings in
PAL before it will agree to conclude a deal with the airline.
	   PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said there was no
such demand, adding that the government's shares in PAL will
naturally be diluted once a deal is forged and Cathay Pacific puts
in new capital.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would agree to any setup in PAL
as long as it remains the country's flag carrier.
	   ``As long as PAL continues and as long as it remains the flag
carrier of the country, so be it,'' he said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debt after being devastated by a pilots' strike
and by Asia's currency crisis.
	   PAL shut down its operations on Sept. 23 after the ground crew
union turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included
a 10-year suspension of labor's collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Workers agreed to accept the plan nearly two weeks after the
shutdown, and the airline resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and
international flights to the United States on Oct. 26.
	   PAL is to resume flights to Hong Kong and Tokyo on Wednesday. It
plans to restart flights to Singapore, Taipei, Fukuoka and Osaka in
the next few weeks.
