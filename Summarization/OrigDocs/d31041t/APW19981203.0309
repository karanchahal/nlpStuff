MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Thursday itwill attempt to rebuild alone after Hong Kong's Cathay PacificAirlines pulled out of talks on acquiring a stake in the ailingPhilippine flag carrier.PAL had hoped for an infusion of capital from another airline tokeep it afloat and help it resume payments on dlrs 2.1 billion indebt.Manolo Aquino, PAL's executive vice president, said the airlinehas prepared a ``stand alone'' rehabilitation plan it will submitnext Monday to Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission.``It does not provide for a foreign-airline partner but if thereis one in the future, that will be an enhancement,'' he said in astatement.Aquino said the plan includes the retention of 22 aircraft _down from 54 _ and the restructuring of debt.Cathay Pacific announced Wednesday that it has withdrawn its bidto pour up to dlrs 100 million into PAL because of ``certain issueswhich could not be resolved.''Philippine officials said Cathay Pacific and PAL disagreed overwho would manage PAL and how many of the more than 8,000 employeeswould lose their jobs.PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing topersuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recoveryplan under which their collective bargaining agreement would besuspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of thecompany.The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL toresume domestic and international flights.Aquino said he welcomed a statement by President Joseph Estradaearlier Thursday that Cathay Pacific is still willing to negotiatewith PAL.``Cathay management wrote me a letter that they are stillavailable for another negotiation,'' Estrada said. ``So let us notlose hope.''Estrada said he is awaiting the return from abroad of PALChairman Lucio Tan to determine if the talks can resume.During the PAL shutdown, Cathay flew chartered domestic flightsat the request of Estrada.``We also owe it to Cathay,'' Estrada said. ``When I asked themto help ... they responded. This in one way or another solved theproblems of so many businesses that were affected. So I think I cantalk it over with them.''PAL says it is unable to make payments on its debts because ofmounting losses worsened by labor problems and Asia's currencycrisis.
