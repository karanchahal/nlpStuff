	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines said Thursday it
will attempt to rebuild alone after Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airlines pulled out of talks on acquiring a stake in the ailing
Philippine flag carrier.
	   PAL had hoped for an infusion of capital from another airline to
keep it afloat and help it resume payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in
debt.
	   Manolo Aquino, PAL's executive vice president, said the airline
has prepared a ``stand alone'' rehabilitation plan it will submit
next Monday to Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   ``It does not provide for a foreign-airline partner but if there
is one in the future, that will be an enhancement,'' he said in a
statement.
	   Aquino said the plan includes the retention of 22 aircraft _
down from 54 _ and the restructuring of debt.
	   Cathay Pacific announced Wednesday that it has withdrawn its bid
to pour up to dlrs 100 million into PAL because of ``certain issues
which could not be resolved.''
	   Philippine officials said Cathay Pacific and PAL disagreed over
who would manage PAL and how many of the more than 8,000 employees
would lose their jobs.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic and international flights.
	   Aquino said he welcomed a statement by President Joseph Estrada
earlier Thursday that Cathay Pacific is still willing to negotiate
with PAL.
	   ``Cathay management wrote me a letter that they are still
available for another negotiation,'' Estrada said. ``So let us not
lose hope.''
	   Estrada said he is awaiting the return from abroad of PAL
Chairman Lucio Tan to determine if the talks can resume.
	   During the PAL shutdown, Cathay flew chartered domestic flights
at the request of Estrada.
	   ``We also owe it to Cathay,'' Estrada said. ``When I asked them
to help ... they responded. This in one way or another solved the
problems of so many businesses that were affected. So I think I can
talk it over with them.''
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on its debts because of
mounting losses worsened by labor problems and Asia's currency
crisis.
