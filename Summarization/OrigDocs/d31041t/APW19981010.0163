	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday the financially troubled Philippine Airlines will resume
its international flights on Sunday by flying him to Singapore
where he will address the World Economic Forum.
	   Debt-laden PAL reopened Wednesday with domestic flights after a
13-day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest labor
union over a management recovery plan.
	   Speaking over his weekly radio program, Estrada also said Cathay
Pacific and Northwest Airlines were interested in investing in the
national carrier.
	   ``It's either of the two,'' he said.
	   Earlier this week, Peter Foster, a regional manager of Cathay,
said the company would soon decide whether to invest in PAL.
	   Foster said Cathay is ``taking a very close look'' at PAL but
declined to comment what they have found or what stake they are
considering.
	   PAL officials say Singapore Airlines is also interested in a
possible investment.
	   PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the
region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   Estrada brokered an agreement between PAL majority owner and
chairman, Lucio Tan, and its largest union that led to the
reopening of the 57-year-old airline.
	   Under the accord, workers will suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for 20 percent
ownership of the airline.
	   Leftist labor leaders say the agreement violates workers' rights
and called Estrada anti-union.
	   The visit to Singapore would be Estrada's first foreign trip as
president.
	   He will deliver the keynote address to the 7th East Asia
Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.
	   Estrada will also hold talks with Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong, Singaporean business leaders and members of the Filipino
community.
	   Estrada said he is scheduled to hold a ``getting-to-know-you''
meeting with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie on Tuesday on
Indonesia's Batam Island south of Singapore.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the discussions
between the two leaders may include immigration and refugee
problems near the two countries' common borders, as well as fishing
and rights to other natural resources in the area.
