MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada saidSaturday the financially troubled Philippine Airlines will resumeits international flights on Sunday by flying him to Singaporewhere he will address the World Economic Forum.Debt-laden PAL reopened Wednesday with domestic flights after a13-day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest laborunion over a management recovery plan.Speaking over his weekly radio program, Estrada also said CathayPacific and Northwest Airlines were interested in investing in thenational carrier.``It's either of the two,'' he said.Earlier this week, Peter Foster, a regional manager of Cathay,said the company would soon decide whether to invest in PAL.Foster said Cathay is ``taking a very close look'' at PAL butdeclined to comment what they have found or what stake they areconsidering.PAL officials say Singapore Airlines is also interested in apossible investment.PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billionin debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by theregion's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers andinflated costs.Estrada brokered an agreement between PAL majority owner andchairman, Lucio Tan, and its largest union that led to thereopening of the 57-year-old airline.Under the accord, workers will suspend their collectivebargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for 20 percentownership of the airline.Leftist labor leaders say the agreement violates workers' rightsand called Estrada anti-union.The visit to Singapore would be Estrada's first foreign trip aspresident.He will deliver the keynote address to the 7th East AsiaEconomic Summit sponsored by the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.Estrada will also hold talks with Singapore Prime Minister GohChok Tong, Singaporean business leaders and members of the Filipinocommunity.Estrada said he is scheduled to hold a ``getting-to-know-you''meeting with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie on Tuesday onIndonesia's Batam Island south of Singapore.Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the discussionsbetween the two leaders may include immigration and refugeeproblems near the two countries' common borders, as well as fishingand rights to other natural resources in the area.
