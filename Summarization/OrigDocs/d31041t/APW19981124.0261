MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines andprospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways have clashed over thelaying off of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks withanother foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from CathayPacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would drawup a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the Philippine flagcarrier.President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora,said the two airlines have disagreed on how many of PAL's more than8,000 workers should be laid off to make the airline viable.Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that Hong Kong-basedCathay Pacific wants to trim PAL's work force to about 5,000, butPAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan did not want to cutthe number of workers below 8,000 to avoid antagonizing thecompany's unions.Cathay Pacific also wants to lay off about 200 PAL pilots, aproposal also opposed by Tan, Zamora said. Tan wants to retain the200 pilots because they stood by him when the majority of PAL'spilots staged a devastating strike in June.Tan has gone to the United States to try to revive talks withNorthwest Airlines, which earlier expressed interest in investingin PAL, Zamora said.Zamora said Northwest was larger than Cathay Pacific ``and maybeits first action would not be to fire employees.''PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo did not comment on the reporteddisagreement but said negotiations between the two companies werecontinuing. He said Cathay Pacific was still studying PAL'sfinancial records.Katherine Wang, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong,said it has not asked PAL to lay off workers. She said thecompanies must first reach agreement on Cathay Pacific's entry intoPAL before such operational details can be discussed.``Our view is that the manpower requirements of PAL are to bediscussed over the long term. Cathay Pacific has no definite planas far as staffing is concerned,'' Wang said.She declined to comment on Zamora's and Espiritu's statementsand said Cathay Pacific's negotiations with PAL ``will still carryon.''PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing topersuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recoveryplan under which its collective bargaining agreement would besuspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of thecompany's stock.The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL toresume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecifiednumber of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workersget separation benefits agreed by both sides.In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At theheight of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers tominimize its losses.PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion ofdebt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems andAsia's currency crisis.
