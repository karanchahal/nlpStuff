	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Saturday
urged militant unionists at Philippine Airlines to accept a vote by
workers approving a 10-year no-strike deal to revive the debt-laden
airline.
	   On Friday, about 61 percent of the members of PAL's largest
union accepted the proposal to suspend collective bargaining in
exchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and seats on its
board.
	   Hardline union members say they will file charges questioning
the legality of agreement, but Estrada urged them to accept the
referendum results.
	   ``It's very clear that majority have agreed to it and voted
freely,'' said Estrada during his weekly radio program. ``Everybody
has to sacrifice. Labor and management should cooperate at this
time of crisis.''
	   Following the outcome of the referendum, PAL said it can resume
flights to 14 domestic destinations next Wednesday and to nine
international destinations within several weeks.
	   It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largest
union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected the
proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of the
country without air service.
	   Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights during
the 10-year CBA suspension. The Philippine president also assured
the International Labor Organization the proposed suspension is
only a temporary measure and would help the government cope with
the Asian crisis.
	   ``It is not true that I am anti-labor,'' he said. ``This is only
a temporary and will not deny workers' rights.''
	   The union had been sharply split over the proposal, with
militant members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement
would violate workers' rights.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Management said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled to
handle domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600 current
workers will be recalled once international flights are fully
operational.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been unable to
make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
