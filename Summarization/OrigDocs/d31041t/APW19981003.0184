MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Saturdayurged militant unionists at Philippine Airlines to accept a vote byworkers approving a 10-year no-strike deal to revive the debt-ladenairline.On Friday, about 61 percent of the members of PAL's largestunion accepted the proposal to suspend collective bargaining inexchange for 20 percent of the company's stock and seats on itsboard.Hardline union members say they will file charges questioningthe legality of agreement, but Estrada urged them to accept thereferendum results.``It's very clear that majority have agreed to it and votedfreely,'' said Estrada during his weekly radio program. ``Everybodyhas to sacrifice. Labor and management should cooperate at thistime of crisis.''Following the outcome of the referendum, PAL said it can resumeflights to 14 domestic destinations next Wednesday and to nineinternational destinations within several weeks.It was the second time that the 6,700 members of PAL's largestunion have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they rejected theproposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving much of thecountry without air service.Estrada assured workers that he will defend their rights duringthe 10-year CBA suspension. The Philippine president also assuredthe International Labor Organization the proposed suspension isonly a temporary measure and would help the government cope withthe Asian crisis.``It is not true that I am anti-labor,'' he said. ``This is onlya temporary and will not deny workers' rights.''The union had been sharply split over the proposal, withmilitant members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreementwould violate workers' rights.Many union members had believed the government would not allowthe 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlistedforeign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, unionleaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the managementplan.The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulatorsand PAL's creditors.Management said at least 2,000 workers will be recalled tohandle domestic operations, and most of the airline's 8,600 currentworkers will be recalled once international flights are fullyoperational.Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount ofmoney it must repay to overseas creditors. It has been unable tomake payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
