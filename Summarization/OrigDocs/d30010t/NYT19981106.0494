WASHINGTON _ President Clinton expressed sympathy to IsraelFriday after a car-bomb explosion in a Jerusalem market wounded 24people but said the attack should not derail the recentland-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.The president said the accord that he helped mediate last monthwas ``the best way to safety for the Israelis, the best way toachieve the aspirations of the Palestinians and, in the end, theonly answer to Friday's act of criminal terror.''Two suicide bombers died in the attack in Jerusalem, whichappeared to be an effort to undermine the Wye agreement, named forthe Maryland conference center where the settlement was reachedlast month.``When Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat signed theWye River agreement, they knew they would face this moment,'' thepresident said, interrupting a bill signing ceremony at the WhiteHouse to discuss the bombing.``They knew when they went home, both of them would be undermore danger and that terrorists would target innocent civilians;they knew they would have to muster a lot of courage in theirpeople,'' he said, expressing ``my sympathy to the people ofIsrael, who this morning were once again the target of a viciousterrorist attack.''``No nation should live under the threat of violence and terrorthat they live under every day,'' he said. ``I ask for your prayersand support today for the Israelis and the Palestinians who believein this agreement and who are determined to carry out theirresponsibilities.''Under the Wye accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ofIsrael agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank,and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to crack downon Palestinian terrorists.The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albrighthad telephoned Netanyahu to express her condolences and to urge himto move quickly, despite the violence, to carry out the agreementreached with the Palestinians.The latest terrorist attack prompted the Israeli Cabinet todelay further consideration of the agreement, a decision thatAlbright said was appropriate as long as it was temporary. ``It iscustomary for there to be a short pause in the wake of this kind ofattack,'' she said at a news conference after speaking withNetanyahu.But she added: ``It is important for the Israeli Cabinet toresume its deliberations quickly. I believe, based on myconversations with the prime minister, that he wants to find a wayto do this.''
