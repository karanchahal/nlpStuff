JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-airmarket Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinetto put off action on the new peace accord.The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for theattack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of theland-for-security accord two weeks ago. On Oct. 29, an assailanttried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewishschoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.The Mahane Yehuda market _ several square blocks of narrow,stone-walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit,vegetables and spices _ was packed with shoppers making last-minutepurchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into theair. Shoppers _ many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirtsor long black frock coats _ fled in panic, some scattering theirpurchases on the street.At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reducedto a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column leftintact. Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by theforce of the blast; a few feet (meters) away was a second body,bare-legged and face down in a pool of blood.Police said they had determined the identities of theassailants, but refused to release any details. Witnesses' accountssuggested the blast had gone off prematurely, perhaps averting amuch larger loss of life.Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from the car andheard a series of popping explosions before a larger blast shookthe area. By then, people had already started running away.``When the big explosion went, there were not that many peoplenearby,'' said witness Yaakov Shlomo. ``That was a miracle fromheaven.''Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris; bynightfall seven people remained hospitalized.Blasted-apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israelradio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intendedto carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method wasused to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago thatkilled the two suicide bombers and 16 others.Israeli officials acknowledged that the toll was remarkablylight for an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said itstill showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.``We can't depend on miracles _ we need to fight the cycle ofterrorism,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. He and otherCabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifyingthe agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their sessionand did not schedule a date for resumption.David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid he still expected the accord to be ratified eventually. Butthe suspension of debate will almost certainly bring delays in thetightly timed 12-week schedule for implementation.The Cabinet it would take up the accord again only afterverifying ``that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous stepsfor an all-out war against terrorist organizations.''Palestinian officials denounced the attack and urged Israel notto let it hold up the accord.``I hope that at this critical period, we will concentrate onthe bigger picture,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekatsaid as he headed into a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. ``Theanswer to extremists on both sides sworn to sabotage this processmust be a big `No.'''He also urged the United States to step in and make sure thatIsrael will ratify the accord.Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests byright-wing Israelis broke out. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!''a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind the policebarricades. Several were arrested.At times like this, Israel has a small-town feel; within momentsof the blast, people all over Jerusalem knew of it.In the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, itself the scene of a suicidebombing 14 months ago, people in open-air cafes clustered aroundradios, listening, nodding and relaying the news. ``Bomb, MahaneYehuda,'' they told passersby.Yair Cohen, 45, a bus-company worker who was shopping at themarket, said that moments before the blast he had given money to abeggar on the street as a ``mitzvah'' _ a good deed that observantJews believe will help lead to their own salvation.``I said to myself, `Maybe this will save my life,''' herecounted later at the hospital, his gray T-shirt stained withblood where he was hit by flying shrapnel. ``And ten minutes later,there was the explosion _ and I really did escape death.''
