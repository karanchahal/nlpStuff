JERUSALEM (AP) _ The father of one of the Islamic militants whodied in the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market saidSaturday he was sad about his son's death but proud of what he haddone.Friday's bombing at the open-air Mahane Yehuda market killed thetwo assailants, injured 21 Israelis and jeopardized the 2-week-oldIsraeli-Palestinian peace accord.Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised to track down themasterminds of the bombing and urged that it not be allowed to setback the new land-for-security agreement.``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confrontthese terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''Arafat said after the attack on the market, which was swarming withshoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafatappeared on Israeli TV and promised to ``exert 100 percent effort''to catch and punish those who had planned the bombing.The radical group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack,but Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militantIslamic Jihad.One of the dead bombers was identified as Yusef Ali MohammedZughayar, who lived in an Israeli-controlled area north ofJerusalem. His family said he was 22 and acknowledged he was activein Islamic Jihad.Palestinian security officials said the other was Suleiman MusaDahayneh, 23, from a village outside the West Bank town of Jenin.At Zughayar's house near the Anata refugee camp, dozens offriends and relatives gathered Saturday to mourn, although theycould not hold a funeral because the body had not been handed overby Israeli authorities.``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Zughayar's54-year-old father, Mohammed. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because Iloved my son.''Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signingof the peace accord on Oct. 23.On Oct. 29, an activist from Hamas killed himself and an Israelisoldier when he tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a buscarrying Jewish schoolchildren.Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expresssorrow over Friday's bombing, but the Israeli leader told him thatfor the peace process to continue, the Palestinians would have tosignificantly step up their war against terrorists.Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack,cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set adate for resuming it.The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its ownmeeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as anexcuse to halt the peace process.The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was farlighter than might have been expected because the explosivesapparently went off prematurely. Many shoppers in the crowdedmarket saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled momentsbefore the main blast.Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radioreported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carryseparate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd.That method was used in an attack at the market 16 months agothat killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
