JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stopsto keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord frombecoming reality.In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli schoolbus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Last month,grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city ofBeersheba.But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict majorcasualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is anindication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have alreadyweakened the militants.In Friday's market attack _ which was initially claimed by thelargest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists fromthe smaller Islamic Jihad group _ Israel radio quoted police asdescribing the explosives as an ``amateur bomb.'' It killed the twobombers and injured 21 Israelis.Yaakov Perry, former, 5th graf pvs.
