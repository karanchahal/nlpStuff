JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-airmarket Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinetto put off action on the new peace accord.The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for theattack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of theland-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailanttried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewishschoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.However, Palestinian security officials said that it was membersof the militant Islamic Jihad group which carried out the attack.The officials identified one of the assailants as Yusef AliMohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem.Anata, which is under Israeli control, straddles the linebetween the West Bank and Jerusalem.Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said that second assailant camefrom the Palestinian controlled areas.In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinianleader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Fridayevening news program and condemned the bombing as ``criminal.''``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confrontthese terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' saida grim-faced Arafat Arafat, adding that he would ``exert 100percent effort'' to track down those involved in the attack.Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expresshis sorrow. The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peaceprocess to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantlystep up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu'soffice said.The Palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack followingtheir meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use itas an excuse to halt the peace process.The Mahane, 3rd graf pvs&UR; kl
