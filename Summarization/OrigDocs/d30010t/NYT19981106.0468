 
   JERUSALEM _ A red Fiat belching smoke sent shoppers fleeing
moments before it exploded outside a bustling marketplace on Friday
morning, killing the two bombers, injuring 24 other people and
disabling the U.S.-brokered peace effort.
 
 
   The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the
peace accord that was reached in Wye Mills, Md., last month and
called on Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was
cracking down on terrorism. Reverberating through the heart of
downtown, the blast Friday morning was the second since the
Israelis and the Palestinians signed the new land-for-security
agreement.
 
 
   The Israelis believe that Islamic Holy War, a militant
fundamentalist organization, bears responsibility for the attack at
the heavily guarded Mahane Yehuda market, where terrorists have
staged several deadly bombings before.
 
 
   The attack occurred during the typical Friday shopping rush
before the Sabbath. At 9:40 a.m., the Fiat, chugging along like a
car about to quit, began emitting smoke. The smoke served as the
first alarm, followed by a series of small explosions, that sounded
like firecrackers. In the minutes before the final boom, as the car
aimed to climb the sidewalk, the police moved quickly to clear the
busy area, in an effort to minimize the final toll. The bombers
died, their car blown to bits of twisted metal. But once the flames
ebbed and the thick black smoke cleared, only one victim proved to
be badly injured.
 
 
   ``I started running like a crazy person,'' said Sigal Yitzer,
who was recovering from minor injuries in a Jerusalem hospital. ``I
thought only of my two 18-month-old twins at home, and if I should
die, who would be their mother?''
 
 
   Arafat condemned the bombing, spending the day in meetings in
Ramallah with his top security advisers and Cabinet. But his aides
expressed concern that the attack had provided Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister, with an excuse for reneging on his
commitment to the peace accord.
 
 
   ``I am sure the result of this terrorist action will be to give
a gift, an umbrella, to Netanyahu,'' said Freich Abu Madein, the
Palestinian minister of justice.
 
 
   Implementation of the accord was supposed to have begun last
Monday, but the Israelis delayed it, with Netanyahu insisting he
needed the approval of his Cabinet and Parliament first. Then, he
postponed convening his Cabinet, demanding written guarantees that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 fugitives.
 
 
   When the Israeli ministers finally met, in a rambunctious
all-day session on Thursday, they indicated that they might give
the peace accord only conditional approval, if any. They had just
reconvened on Friday morning when they received news of the
explosion. They immediately moved to suspend their vote on the
accord _ and thus, its implementation _ until Arafat declared
``all-out war'' on terrorism, according to Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh.
 
 
   ``We expect Arafat to do what is being demanded of him,'' said
Silvan Shalom, the Israeli minister of science. ``He needs to
combat the terror infrastructure. He has done that in the past and
he needs to do so now.''
 
 
   Netanyahu issued no public statements. He did not visit the
scene, and he did not visit the injured at the hospital.
