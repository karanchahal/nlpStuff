JERUSALEM _ A red Fiat belching smoke sent shoppers fleeingmoments before it exploded outside a bustling marketplace on Fridaymorning, killing the two bombers, injuring 24 other people anddisabling the U.S.-brokered peace effort.The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on thepeace accord that was reached in Wye Mills, Md., last month andcalled on Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he wascracking down on terrorism. Reverberating through the heart ofdowntown, the blast Friday morning was the second since theIsraelis and the Palestinians signed the new land-for-securityagreement.The Israelis believe that Islamic Holy War, a militantfundamentalist organization, bears responsibility for the attack atthe heavily guarded Mahane Yehuda market, where terrorists havestaged several deadly bombings before.The attack occurred during the typical Friday shopping rushbefore the Sabbath. At 9:40 a.m., the Fiat, chugging along like acar about to quit, began emitting smoke. The smoke served as thefirst alarm, followed by a series of small explosions, that soundedlike firecrackers. In the minutes before the final boom, as the caraimed to climb the sidewalk, the police moved quickly to clear thebusy area, in an effort to minimize the final toll. The bombersdied, their car blown to bits of twisted metal. But once the flamesebbed and the thick black smoke cleared, only one victim proved tobe badly injured.``I started running like a crazy person,'' said Sigal Yitzer,who was recovering from minor injuries in a Jerusalem hospital. ``Ithought only of my two 18-month-old twins at home, and if I shoulddie, who would be their mother?''Arafat condemned the bombing, spending the day in meetings inRamallah with his top security advisers and Cabinet. But his aidesexpressed concern that the attack had provided Benjamin Netanyahu,the Israeli prime minister, with an excuse for reneging on hiscommitment to the peace accord.``I am sure the result of this terrorist action will be to givea gift, an umbrella, to Netanyahu,'' said Freich Abu Madein, thePalestinian minister of justice.Implementation of the accord was supposed to have begun lastMonday, but the Israelis delayed it, with Netanyahu insisting heneeded the approval of his Cabinet and Parliament first. Then, hepostponed convening his Cabinet, demanding written guarantees thatthe Palestinians would arrest 30 fugitives.When the Israeli ministers finally met, in a rambunctiousall-day session on Thursday, they indicated that they might givethe peace accord only conditional approval, if any. They had justreconvened on Friday morning when they received news of theexplosion. They immediately moved to suspend their vote on theaccord _ and thus, its implementation _ until Arafat declared``all-out war'' on terrorism, according to Cabinet Secretary DannyNaveh.``We expect Arafat to do what is being demanded of him,'' saidSilvan Shalom, the Israeli minister of science. ``He needs tocombat the terror infrastructure. He has done that in the past andhe needs to do so now.''Netanyahu issued no public statements. He did not visit thescene, and he did not visit the injured at the hospital.nn
