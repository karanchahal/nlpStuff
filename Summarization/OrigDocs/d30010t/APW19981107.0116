	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops
to keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord from
becoming reality.
	   In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli school
bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Last month,
grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of
Beersheba.
	   But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major
casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an
indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already
weakened the militants.
	   In Friday's market attack _ which was initially claimed by the
largest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists from
the smaller Islamic Jihad group _ Israel radio quoted police as
describing the explosives as an ``amateur bomb.'' It killed the two
bombers and injured 21 Israelis.
	   Yaakov Perry, former head of the Israeli Shin Bet, told The
Associated Press that raids by Israeli agents and, in recent weeks,
by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest of
key leaders and the killing of expert bombmakers.
	   ``There is a weakness both in the explosives used and the
engineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there is
also a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves,'' he
said, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.
	   Abdel-Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in the
West Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of the
Islamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on the
radicals.
	   As part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.
	   ``It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep your
promises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be a
response that will curb your efforts to reach agreement with
Israel,'' Qassem said.
	   He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a school
bus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing of
two Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and the
death of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.
	   Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said the
Israeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideast
peace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake that
only encouraged Hamas and other groups.
	   Gilon said the aim of the militants was to ``ruin the whole
process. I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which is
exactly the aim of Hamas _ to stop Wye.''
	   In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide-bombings by Islamic
militants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peace
process, bringing to power the hard-line government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat's police rounded up the
militants then, but the activists were later released from jail.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossible
to continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forces
were doing so little.
	   He predicted that the militants would keep attacking until
Arafat's police uprooted the sources of support _ including
charities that collected money, teachers that recruited the youth
and clergy who encouraged attacks. He said Israel was merely lucky
that recent attacks hadn't claimed more casualties.
	   ``We can't rely any longer on miracles. We have to have some
action on the part of the Palestinian Authority,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's market
bombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinet
said Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.
	   ``We want to tell him that if you put pressure on the
Palestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, those
groups will point their arrows against you,'' Communications
Minister Imad Falouji told the crowd.
	   Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of the
Islamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed
``our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and laws
dictate.''
	   Many in the crowd cheered.
