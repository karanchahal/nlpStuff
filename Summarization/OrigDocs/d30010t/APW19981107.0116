JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stopsto keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord frombecoming reality.In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli schoolbus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Last month,grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city ofBeersheba.But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict majorcasualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is anindication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have alreadyweakened the militants.In Friday's market attack _ which was initially claimed by thelargest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists fromthe smaller Islamic Jihad group _ Israel radio quoted police asdescribing the explosives as an ``amateur bomb.'' It killed the twobombers and injured 21 Israelis.Yaakov Perry, former head of the Israeli Shin Bet, told TheAssociated Press that raids by Israeli agents and, in recent weeks,by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest ofkey leaders and the killing of expert bombmakers.``There is a weakness both in the explosives used and theengineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there isalso a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves,'' hesaid, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.Abdel-Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in theWest Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of theIslamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response toPalestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on theradicals.As part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader,Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.``It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep yourpromises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be aresponse that will curb your efforts to reach agreement withIsrael,'' Qassem said.He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a schoolbus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing oftwo Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and thedeath of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said theIsraeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideastpeace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake thatonly encouraged Hamas and other groups.Gilon said the aim of the militants was to ``ruin the wholeprocess. I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which isexactly the aim of Hamas _ to stop Wye.''In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide-bombings by Islamicmilitants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peaceprocess, bringing to power the hard-line government of PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat's police rounded up themilitants then, but the activists were later released from jail.David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossibleto continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forceswere doing so little.He predicted that the militants would keep attacking untilArafat's police uprooted the sources of support _ includingcharities that collected money, teachers that recruited the youthand clergy who encouraged attacks. He said Israel was merely luckythat recent attacks hadn't claimed more casualties.``We can't rely any longer on miracles. We have to have someaction on the part of the Palestinian Authority,'' Bar-Illan said.At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's marketbombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinetsaid Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements inthe West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.``We want to tell him that if you put pressure on thePalestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, thosegroups will point their arrows against you,'' CommunicationsMinister Imad Falouji told the crowd.Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of theIslamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed``our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and lawsdictate.''Many in the crowd cheered.___ &QC;EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nicolas B.
