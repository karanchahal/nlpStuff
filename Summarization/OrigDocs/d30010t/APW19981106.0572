JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb blew up Friday in a Jerusalem marketcrowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast killedtwo assailants, wounded 21 Israelis and prompted Israel to suspendimplementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying tosabotage the agreement, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market.Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding upthe agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percentof the West Bank by the end of January.In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the mainintersection at the market entrance, smoke coming out of the hoodand windows. ``People started to shout `car on fire,''' said YairCohen, a bus company employee.Rahel Zaken, waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath bread,turned toward the street and got a glimpse of the driver. ``I sawhis eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 32-year-oldsecretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars andcrawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalizedafter complainging of ringing in the ears.Others said they heard two explosions, followed by fast pops,like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said two suitcasesfilled with explosives were recovered near the car, suggesting theblast went off prematurely and that the assailants had planned toset off a more powerful explosion.Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeksthat Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with largenumbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdownby Israel and the Palestinian Authority has produced results.A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay severalmeters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool ofblood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with soddenpieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two dead were theassailants. Asked about Hamas' apparent difficulty to launch alarge-scale attack, he said: ``We can't depend on miracles.''The explosion turned the car into a mass of twisted metal, and alarge cloud of smoke engulfed the area.``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, anIsraeli border policeman. Soldiers and police held back the crowds.``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiestthoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, somefrantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowdedmarket only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.``Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?''an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her waypast police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blueplastic shopping bag filled with groceries.A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death toArafat!'' Police tried to grab one of them, but he escaped into thecrowd.Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about theirbusiness. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when thishappens,'' one young female shopper said.In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just afew meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killingthemselves and 16 shoppers.When Friday's blast rocked downtown Jerusalem, the IsraeliCabinet had just gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, atNetanyahu's office, to discuss the peace agreement under whichIsrael is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchangefor a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by theCabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of thesession that he had expected a vote later Friday.However, the session broke off when word of the attack reachedthe ministers. The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, withministers deciding to suspend the ratification process.The Cabinet said in a statement will only reconvene after ``itverifies that the Palestinian Authority takes vigorous steps for anall-out war against terrorist organizations and theirinfrastructure.''The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned theattack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militantsby suspending the peace process.He also said the Palestinians were doing all they could to stopthe violence. ``I wished that the Israeli government would notpoint its finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said.Bar-Illan said ratification was possible as early as next weekif the Palestinians take decisive steps against militants.The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leaderYasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLOfounding charter calling for Israel's destruction.The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vagueenough to allow different interpretations. It says the PalestineNational Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet inmid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. PresidentBill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out whichclauses are being annulled.The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreementcalls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem asIsrael's capital. Israel radio initially said the ministers decidedto begin construction of the controversial Jewish neighborhood ofHar Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next. Bar-Illan saidconstruction would be authorized ``in the near future,'' but wouldnot give a date.&UR; kl
