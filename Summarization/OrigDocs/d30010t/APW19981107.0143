CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president says there is ``virtuallynobody'' who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuwill implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak saidif Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly facethe setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalemthat killed the two bombers and injured 21.``I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezingnegotiations,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government-runEgyptian Mail newspaper.Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations andPalestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him. Mubarak'scomments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincereabout peace, and that it only looks for excuses to retain controlover West Bank.Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence. But ``doeslife come to a halt? On the contrary. The peace foes who are manyshould be denied the chance,'' he was quoted as saying.Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinetsuspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached lastmonth with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan touproot terrorists on Palestinian-controlled areas.Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct. 23 he wascautioning that implementation of the deal was more important thanwords.``This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (inJerusalem) would happen,'' he said.However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.``I tell ... Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who truststhat you will carry out the Wye River accord. Should you want tochange this perception, you have to take the initiative and makepractical steps to comply with ... the agreement,'' Mubarak wasquoted as saying.Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, hesaid.``The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they shouldbe supported, not the other way round,'' he said.On normalizing Arab-Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoplesshould accept the idea first before anything is imposed by``supreme decrees.''And people can only be won over by ``sowing the seeds of trust,by handing over land to their rightful owners and respectingtreaties and accords.'' he said.&UR; vj/mae
