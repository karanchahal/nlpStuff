JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalemmarket crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blastkilled two, apparently the assailants, and wounded 21 Israelis. Inresponse, Israel's Cabinet suspended implementation of the newpeace accord with the Palestinians.The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying tosabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.(0745 GMT) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said.Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeksthat Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with largenumbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdownby Israel and the Palestinian Authority has had an effect.Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused PrimeMinister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding upthe agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percentof the West Bank.In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the mainintersection at the entrance of the outdoor market, smoke comingout of the hood and windows.Rahel Zaken, who was waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbathbread, turned toward the street and glimpsed the driver. ``I sawhis eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 23-year-oldsecretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars andcrawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalizedafter complaining of ringing in the ears.Other witnesses said they heard two explosions, followed by fastpops, like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said twosuitcases filled with explosives were found near the car,suggesting the blast went off prematurely and that the assailantshad planned a more powerful explosion.Israel TV said the two dead were the assailants.A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay severalmeters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool ofblood.In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just afew meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killingthemselves and 16 shoppers.When Friday's explosion went off, the Israeli Cabinet had justgathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at Netanyahu's office, todiscuss the peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian campaignagainst Islamic militants.The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by theCabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of thesession that he had expected a vote later Friday.However, the session broke off when word of the attack reachedthe ministers. Later, the ministers decided to indefinitely suspendthe ratification process.``The government of Israel will resume the discussion of theagreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority istaking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terroristorganizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat condemned theattack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militantsby suspending the peace process.``I wished that the Israeli government would not point itsfinger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said. ``ThePalestinian Authority is exerting the maximum effort to foil terrorand violence.''The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leaderYasser Arafat on the procedure for removing sections of the PLOcharter calling for Israel's destruction.The Wye River agreement says the Palestine National Council andother Palestinian organizations will meet in mid-December to``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton thatspells out the clauses being annulled.Israel contends that the agreement requires the PNC to hold avote on the clauses.The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem asIsrael's capital. Bar-Illan said construction would be authorized``in the near future'' of the controversial Jewish neighborhood ofHar Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, but would not give adate.At the scene of Friday's explosion along Jerusalem's busiestthoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, somefrantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowdedmarket only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death toArafat!''Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about theirbusiness. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when thishappens,'' one young female shopper said.
