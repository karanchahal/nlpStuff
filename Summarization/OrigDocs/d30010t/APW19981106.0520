	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalem
market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast
killed two, apparently the assailants, and wounded 21 Israelis. In
response, Israel's Cabinet suspended implementation of the new
peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 GMT) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said.
	   Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks
that Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with large
numbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdown
by Israel and the Palestinian Authority has had an effect.
	   Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up
the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the entrance of the outdoor market, smoke coming
out of the hood and windows.
	   Rahel Zaken, who was waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath
bread, turned toward the street and glimpsed the driver. ``I saw
his eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 23-year-old
secretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.
	   ``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and
crawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalized
after complaining of ringing in the ears.
	   Other witnesses said they heard two explosions, followed by fast
pops, like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said two
suitcases filled with explosives were found near the car,
suggesting the blast went off prematurely and that the assailants
had planned a more powerful explosion.
	   Israel TV said the two dead were the assailants.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of
blood.
	   In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just a
few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   When Friday's explosion went off, the Israeli Cabinet had just
gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at Netanyahu's office, to
discuss the peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign
against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of the
session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. Later, the ministers decided to indefinitely suspend
the ratification process.
	   ``The government of Israel will resume the discussion of the
agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is
taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat condemned the
attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants
by suspending the peace process.
	   ``I wished that the Israeli government would not point its
finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said. ``The
Palestinian Authority is exerting the maximum effort to foil terror
and violence.''
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for removing sections of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement says the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will meet in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton that
spells out the clauses being annulled.
	   Israel contends that the agreement requires the PNC to hold a
vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Bar-Illan said construction would be authorized
``in the near future'' of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of
Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, but would not give a
date.
	   At the scene of Friday's explosion along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded
market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death to
Arafat!''
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this
happens,'' one young female shopper said.
