CHICAGO _ She says he is ``duplicitous,'' a ``wolf in sheep'sclothing'' who has resorted to ``scuzzball'' campaign tactics inthe past. He has described her as ``shrill,'' claims she ``hasnothing positive to say about her own record'' and that her careerhas been ``obscured by numerous scandals and controversies.''The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, CarolMoseley-Braun, and state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservativeRepublican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns inthe country. And with less than a month to go, the candidates havedropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune,suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantlyrising star, is in serious election trouble. She lagged behindFitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying theybelieved Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, alsosuggested that she has lost considerable support among suburbanwomen, one of the main groups that swept her into office six yearsago in what became known as the ``Year of the Woman.''Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in herpersonal and political life, Ms. Moseley-Braun, 51, who wascatapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become thenation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting votersto focus on her legislative accomplishments. And she has beensoundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire fromthe Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune andspent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.``Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as wellas I could have?'' Ms. Moseley-Braun said in an interview.``There's no question about that. Have I not handled the politicsas well as I could have? No question. But I certainly have workedas hard as I can. I've got a great legislative record. And with allthe things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck.''Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republicanleaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contestedprimary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms.Moseley-Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterizationof him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.``Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerousscandals and controversies, those who have noticed her votingrecord have noticed it is very extreme,'' Fitzgerald said in aninterview.Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republicanwho is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman fromdownstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretaryof State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition toabortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his pastvotes against gun control and environmental measures. And he hastried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in whichemployees of the secretary of state's office are accused of takingbribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of thebribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavilyDemocratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too. This year,the state legislature eliminated straight-party voting in Illinois,long considered a boon to Democrats. And although Democrats arehoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeachPresident Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind ofbacklash, so far the president's problems have not helped mattersand could lower turnout among Democratic voters. ( Poshard evenstayed away from a Chicago fund-raiser on his behalf which Clintonattended).All of that is making things harder for Ms. Moseley-Braun in arace that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.``I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, evenagainst Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be thistough,'' said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in1994.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnThe senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to adebate, which was held on Sunday. After it was over, she said shehad not expected him to try to ``paint himself as a centrist'' andsaid, ``I could have made him show his true colors better.''Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded ``shrill'' inthe debate and that she ``wasn't even able to understand what I wastalking about when I was talking about Social Security.''Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary becausethey believed his conservative views would make him easier todefeat.Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soonafter he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed himto be more independent in his political views. He opposes abortion,even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into lawby Edgar that bans same-sex marriages and would screen gay peopleout of the military. He would use the federal budget surplus toprovide tax cuts, while Ms. Moseley-Braun would use it to shore upSocial Security.Ms. Moseley-Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, hasconcentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities,fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for womenand fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issuesimportant in Illinois.But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusationsthat she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid forher mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment againsther 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, andthat she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollarson personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms.Moseley-Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she hasnot been able to shake what she calls her ``negatives.'' A fewweeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, thesenator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as avictim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan,forcing her to apologize.``She knows that she's in a dogfight. Most incumbents don't wantto debate,'' said Paul Green, a professor of political science atGovernors State University in Chicago.In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun, acharismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reachdisaffected supporters. Her campaign has raised about $6 million(compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and hasscheduled fund-raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clintonand Hillary Rodham Clinton.``I've worked myself already into bad health,'' said Ms.Moseley-Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia ata Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas. ``I'mdoing everything I know how.''
