WASHINGTON _ Rep. Louise Slaughter has not been a big fan of herfellow Democrat Bill Clinton. She thinks that he was a major reasonthe Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, that he has struckone too many deals with the Republicans, and that his behavior hasbeen reckless and abhorrent. Two months ago, she was on the vergeof urging him to resign.But as the House prepares to vote on whether to open animpeachment inquiry into the president, Ms. Slaughter, fromRochester, N.Y., finds herself deeply torn. As much as she wouldnot mind seeing Bill Clinton out of office, she worries thatCongress is about to start down a path the Founding Fathers neverenvisioned.``I'm not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton,'' shesaid. ``It's the country and the Constitution I'm concernedabout.''Rep. Jim Maloney, D-Conn., is in a different bind. He is lockedin one of the toughest races of any House member, against achallenger who has made Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky amajor campaign issue. Yet Maloney also believes that the majorityof his constituents are fed up with demeaning investigations intothe president.So while the freshman congressman could support a limitedinvestigation, he remains painfully uncertain about how to vote onwhat may be the only alternative available to him: a Republicanplan that would allow an open-ended inquiry that he fears coulddrag on for years.``If we do that, we'll just be opening the door to the partisanmischief that has been going on for so long around this place,'' hesaid.Across Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the fence sitters inWashington's impeachment debate were consulting constitutionalscholars, meeting with colleagues and spouses, rereading theFederalist Papers and studying their political tea leaves,searching for any inspiration that could help tip their mentalscales one way or the other.Most were preparing to follow party lines, but among thatdwindling group of undecideds are two large groups of Democratsfacing different pressures.On one side are people like Ms. Slaughter, who have becomedeeply disaffected with Clinton, and who believe he has done littleto advance the congressional Democrats' agenda and now feelhesitant about helping him out of his bind.On the other are people like Maloney, who are locked in toughre-election fights and who are concerned that appearing soft onClinton will infuriate swing voters.``What will I do before I decide?'' asked Rep. Bill PascrellJr., D-N.J., who is also among the fence sitters. ``I'll pray. Andthen I'll move on.''(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Ms. Slaughter saidClinton would not be a factor in her decision. ``He happens to beoccupying the important spot there, and I want to do what I can topreserve the presidency,'' she said.But she recalled with evident disgust a phone call in Augustfrom a White House official who was looking for ``SenatorSlaughter'' and who expressed surprise that she had an office inRochester. ``That's how far down the list I am, I guess,'' shesaid.She also said Clinton's poor relations with congressionalDemocrats had hurt the party's congressional candidates in 1996 and1994. ``He didn't say this, but Dick Morris said it for him: BillClinton didn't care who ran for Congress,'' she said.Ms. Slaughter said she was prepared in August to call on Clintonto resign, but backed away after seeing his videotaped performancefor the grand jury. ``I thought his rights were, frankly, abridgedterribly,'' she said. ``No other human being in the United Stateswould have been subjected to that.''In recent days, Ms. Slaughter said, she had been speaking toconstitutional scholars about impeachment precedents, and meetingwith small groups of colleagues from both parties who remainundecided. At this moment, she is leaning toward voting against aninquiry.``We're not trying to get by an election, or get by a hard spothere,'' she said. ``What we do here has ramifications far beyondour lives.''Maloney said he had been studying the report of the Whitewaterindependent counsel, Kenneth Starr, reviewing Clinton's rebuttalsand videotaped testimony, talking with friends on the HouseJudiciary Committee and trying to listen to constituents. Thelatter group, he says, falls into three equal subgroups: those whowant the matter dropped, those who want Clinton impeached, andthose who want some lesser punishment.Maloney, a former state senator, represents a westernConnecticut district that was held by Republicans for many years,including Gov. John Rowland, until Maloney wrested it from Rep.Gary Franks in the Clinton landslide of 1996. Since then, Maloneyhas tiptoed across party lines on many occasions, including tosupport a Republican tax-cut plan this year.Maloney's Republican opponent, state Sen. Mark Nielsen, hascalled on Clinton to resign, and said Wednesday that he would makeit an issue if Maloney votes against an impeachment inquiry. ``TheCongress can't turn a blind eye to President Clinton'scriminality,'' he said. ``And the congressman from the 5th Districtcan't be a part of the Clinton defense strategy.''Maloney contends that such talk only turns voters off and that amore thoughtful approach is what will sell in November. ``I havesaid this doesn't belong in politics,'' he said. ``I read theConstitution in a given way. It isn't anything goes.''Maloney said he would support a six-month inquiry withwell-defined parameters, which could include the Lewinsky matterand any other matters referred by the independent counsel. If theHouse can agree to such a bipartisan plan, Maloney said, hisdecision on Thursday will be easy.``But that's not what I'm expecting,'' he said.
