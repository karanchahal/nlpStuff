LOS ANGELES _ In 1992, in a good year for Democrats, BarbaraBoxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48 percent of the vote.In the six years since, she has been a reliably outspoken liberalfrom a state that is less so, and has never managed to lift her jobapproval ratings above 50 percent.Now, in what is shaping up as a bad year for Democrats, Ms.Boxer is struggling to hold her own against a comparative neophyte,the Republican state treasurer, Matt Fong. Their contest has becomeone of a handful of closely watched races that will determinewhether the Republicans can win a filibuster-proof 60-seat majoritythat could shape the congressional landscape for years.As the House of Representatives prepares to debate whether toopen a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's conductin the Monica Lewinsky matter, much attention has focused on theplight of House Democrats in swing districts.But from California to Wisconsin, from Illinois to Nevada, fromKentucky to South Carolina, Senate seats now held by Democrats arealso in jeopardy, raising the possibility of the biggest Republicanmajority in the Senate since the administration of Warren G.Harding in 1921-23, when the party held 59 seats in a 96-memberbody.``It's just that the Republicans have more opportunities, andbetter opportunities,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of arespected independent political newsletter in Washington. ``TheDemocrats are definitely still on the defensive, and it shows.''Although Clinton's own job approval ratings jumped to near hishighest ever after the release of his videotaped grand jurytestimony last month, that support has generally not carried overto Democratic incumbents around the country, some of whom, likeBoxer and Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, were vulnerablelong before Clinton's current troubles ever surfaced.In the Senate alone, Democrats have lost 11 seats sinceClinton's 1992 victory, and Republicans hold a 55-45 majority.``Publicly, the congressional Democrats defend the president abit,'' said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at RutgersUniversity and a leading expert on the Senate. ``But privately,they're angry and worried and scared.``It's a case of the ship leaving the sinking rats.''One senior Democratic senator, now in his fourth term, summed upthe situation this way, speaking on the condition of anonymity.``When I came here, there were 64 Democratic senators,'' thesenator said. ``Now we'll be lucky to get 42.''With its magisterial pace, rarefied folkways and six-yearelection cycles, the Senate has always been less subject to thevicissitudes of voter sentiment than the House, whose entiremembership faces re-election every two years.But when changes in the Senate do occur, experience has shownthat they can be big changes.In years like 1980, for example, when the Republicans took amajority as Ronald Reagan was elected president, or 1986, when theparty lost control of the Senate (and lost more seats there than itdid in the House), or 1994, when the Democrats lost control of bothhouses after the failure of Clinton's proposed health careoverhaul, ``all the close races went one way,'' Rothenberg said.If Republicans win all the close Senate races where they are nowthought to be in striking distance, experts say they could wellmake the net gain of five seats needed to reach 60, the number ofvotes needed to cut off floor debate and block a Democraticfilibuster.``I think there's about a 30 percent chance of that happening,''said Jennifer E. Duffy, the Senate editor of the Cook PoliticalReport, another highly regarded nonpartisan newsletter inWashington. ``A gain of three seats is the worst they'll do.''Of the 34 Senate seats up this year, 10 are considered safelyRepublican and 9 safely Democratic.The Ohio seat being vacated by John Glenn, a Democrat who isretiring, is considered a likely bet for Gov. George Voinovich, aRepublican, while the Republican seat in Indiana being surrenderedby Dan Coats is likely to be won by former Gov. Evan Bayh, aDemocrat seeking to reclaim the office once held by his father,Birch.That means Republicans would have to hold onto all 5 of theremaining seats the party now holds, from New York, North Carolina,Missouri, Colorado and Georgia, and pick up 6 of the remaining 8Democratic-held seats to achieve the net gain of 5 seats needed toreach 60. Their best bets are Illinois, California, Kentucky,Nevada, Wisconsin, Washington state and South Carolina.Democratic senators are in trouble for a range of reasons, fromchanging voter demographics, which have left incumbents like HarryReid of Nevada and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina facingelectorates decidedly more Republican than the ones that chose themto begin with, to the failure of some senators, like Boxer andMoseley-Braun, to solidify their original base of support.Moseley-Braun, like Boxer a member of the 1992 ``Year of theWoman'' class and the first black woman ever elected to the Senate,is running 10 points behind her Republican challenger, state Sen.Peter Fitzgerald, in the latest polls, and national Democraticofficials seem to have all but conceded the seat. In Washingtonstate, another member of the 1992 class, Patty Murray, holds only aslight lead over her Republican challenger, Rep. Linda Smith.nnIn Wisconsin, Russell Feingold, the Democratic co-sponsor of thecampaign finance reform bill that bears his name, is testing thatproposition in his own race, eschewing ``soft-money'' contributionsfrom his national party. He recently let his opponent, Rep. MarkNeumann, broadcast a heavy dose of unanswered televisioncommercials. Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report moved that race into thetoss-up category last week.The Kentucky seat being vacated by Sen. Wendell Ford, aDemocrat, appears to be a tossup between Representative ScottyBaesler, a Democrat, and Jim Bunning, a Republican, with the mostrecent independent poll showing a virtual dead heat.Boxer's situation is fairly typical, with some problems of herown making and others exacerbated by Clinton, to whom she isrelated by marriage. Her daughter, Nicole, is married to TonyRodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, and the senator took someheat for her initially low-key comments about the Lewinsky scandal,especially given her past outspoken opposition to Sen. Bob Packwoodand Judge Clarence Thomas over allegations of sexual harassmentagainst them.After Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of an ``inappropriate''relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Boxer eventually condemned hisbehavior in strong terms on the Senate floor, but not until wellafter her California colleague, Dianne Feinstein, had issued herown stinging rebuke of Clinton.But Fong, who was elected state treasurer just four years agoand whose inexperience on the stump showed in his first debate withBoxer this summer, is hardly a powerhouse candidate. Boxer has heldroughly a 2-to-1 fund-raising advantage over him throughout theyear, and he barely eked out a victory in the Republican primary inJune against Darrel Issa, a millionaire businessman.``If Barbara Boxer were all that strong politically, she'd beway ahead of Matt Fong,'' Rothenberg said. ``She would have put himaway long ago.''Instead, recent polls have shown the candidates in either a deadheat, or Fong slightly ahead among likely voters, though aDemocratic operative not affiliated with either campaign said thatrecent private Democratic polls had shown Ms. Boxer opening asingle-digit lead.Fong began his television advertising campaign last week, withads in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish touting his supportfor education and aimed at making inroads among minority voterswhom Republicans often overlook, though only the English-languageversion stresses the necessity for children to ``read, write andspeak English so they are prepared to get a job.''By contrast, Boxer has been on the air for about three weeks,most recently with a 30-second commercial, narrated by actor MartinSheen, that denounces Fong as ``the gun lobby's favoritecandidate'' and touts her support for new bans on assault weaponsand cheap handguns. Unlike Feinstein, Boxer has largely failed tomove beyond her liberal base and establish a strong anti-crimereputation.In that regard, Boxer's first ad was perhaps even morerevealing. Broadcast in her home turf of San Francisco andfeaturing footage from old family home movies, it was a soft-edgedhymn to her support for children, in the form of after-schoolprograms to keep them ``out of gangs, and criminal backgroundchecks for child-care workers.''``It's all about her losing a lot of her base from '92 andhaving to get it back,'' said Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report. ``Thiswas for the soccer moms she should already have.''The national Republican Senatorial Committee is closely watchingCalifornia as a promising contest, along with Nevada, Wisconsin anda handful of others, said a spokesman for the committee, MikeRussell. He declined to speculate about how much the party mightspend to help Fong make his case, but acknowledged that ``it'scertainly a race where those kinds of resources could make adifference.''``In Boxer, you have a candidate who is stuck at 45 percent orbelow, and has no real room to grow, since most people in the statealready know her and have fixed opinions of her,'' Russell said.``Matt is not only a sharp candidate, but as an Asian-American canchew into her base.''Even if the Republicans could win control of 60 seats, thatwould be far from the most lopsided margin in Senate history. Afterthe election of 1936, at the height of the New Deal, the Democratsheld 75 seats, to 17 for the Republicans and the remaining splitamong minor parties. And after Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide,the Democrats had 68 seats to 32 for the Republicans.Moreover, Baker of Rutgers noted, maverick Republicans likeSens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords ofVermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island so regularly break ranksthat even 60 Republican seats would not be enough to guarantee anironclad defense against a Democratic filibuster.``It's such an individualistic institution,'' he said. ``It'ssuch a place of personalities and individuals, and there's a realaversion on the part of senators to appear to be part of a herd, orpart of an unshakable bloc of votes.''
