 
   NEW YORK _ Anyone following the U.S. Senate race in New York
this year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of the
epic ideological battles of the 1990s: the right-wing extremist,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn congressman,
Charles Schumer.
 
 
   On one side is D'Amato, who, as Schumer said again Sunday, voted
to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled
environmentalists. On the other is Schumer, who, as D'Amato likes
to say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions and
supported a series of tax increases.
 
 
   But the truth behind these ideological caricatures is
considerably more complex, despite the best efforts of Schumer and
D'Amato to confuse it. These two candidates for Senate are, in
fact, political hybrids, masters of the fluid school of politics
and ideology that has emerged in U.S. elections in the 1990s, and
very much in the tradition of such successful politicians as Bill
Clinton, Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.
 
 
   Like Clinton, who campaigned in the New Hampshire Democratic
primary in 1992 on a promise to slash welfare, and Pataki, who ran
for New York governor in 1994 by embracing the environmental
movement, D'Amato and Schumer have defied just enough of their
parties' orthodoxy to resist easy characterization.
 
 
   Their legislative histories are certainly littered with votes
that permit their opponents to paint them as extreme, like
Schumer's voting in the state Assembly to weaken drug laws, or
D'Amato's championing of much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
Contract With America. But like most New Yorkers _ or more
specifically, like most people who will vote on Nov. 3 _ the
three-term Republican senator and his Democratic challenger are
closer to the center than to either extreme.
 
 
   ``I do not think they are as different as they say,'' said the
Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who ran for the
Democratic nomination to challenge D'Amato in 1992. ``Chuck has
always been right of center in the Democratic Party, and D'Amato
has always been, well, whatever works for him on that given day.
They are both rewriting as they go.''
 
 
   The flood of conflicting vote citations and ideological
name-calling that have filled the state's airwaves notwithstanding,
these first three weeks of the general election campaign have been
less about ideology and more about tactics. With a nod to the
political reality of the moderate cast of New York's electorate,
D'Amato and Schumer are each trying to accomplish the same thing,
if from different corners of the ring: to cover the tracks of their
own political evolution while portraying their opponent as extreme.
 
 
   This maneuvering began on the first day of the general election
campaign as D'Amato attacked Schumer as liberal while the
representative assailed D'Amato as soft on crime. And it has
continued every day since then, testimony to one of the most
enduring facts of this contest: Whatever their differences on
issues, as political tacticians, Schumer and D'Amato have similar
reflexes.
 
 
   This is nothing new for D'Amato. He has historically prepared
for each election with a march on the political center, and then
campaigned by portraying his opponents, notably Robert Abrams, the
state attorney general, in 1992, as liberal vestiges. This formula,
combined with a record of tending to the more parochial needs of
the state and its voters, largely accounts for D'Amato's repeated
success at winning re-election in what is, by registration, a
strongly Democratic state.
 
 
   What is different this time is that D'Amato has encountered in
Schumer a challenger who is trying to do to the senator what the
senator typically does to his opponent. The representative has
parried each ideological assault by D'Amato by asserting that it is
the senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurring
his own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his own
march on the political center as he prepared in Congress for this
race.
 
 
   It seems unlikely that Schumer will ever convince voters that he
is, for example, tougher on crime than D'Amato, or that D'Amato is
a foot soldier for Gingrich's Republican revolution. But at the
very least, by echoing D'Amato's tactics, Schumer may succeed in
neutralizing a weapon that D'Amato has used against previous
opponents to devastating effect.
 
 
   D'Amato certainly has a basis for saying that Schumer is to the
left of most of the U.S. electorate. Schumer voted against the 1996
bill that restricted welfare benefits. He opposed the
balanced-budget amendment. He has supported a series of tax
increases over the years. He voted for federal legislation that
would ban discrimination in hiring homosexuals. He has voted
against measures that would make it easier to jail juveniles in
adult prisons, and against another measure that would have imposed
additional penalties for crimes involving the use of guns.
 
 
   But Schumer, who has spent many of his 18 years in Congress
preparing for the seven weeks of this general election campaign,
has also repeatedly voted in favor of a federal death penalty.
(Though Schumer earlier in his life opposed the death penalty.) He
was the sponsor of legislation to provide funds to hire police
officers and to ban many forms of assault weapons. He voted to
restrict the rights of illegal immigrants in some cases, and in
favor of legislation to crack down on food-stamp fraud. He
supported the line-item veto. He also voted in favor of a measure
that would ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
 
 
   Similarly, on many levels, D'Amato's Republican credentials seem
more than secure. He has opposed abortion rights throughout his
career, and voted against gun control. He has supported many
aspects of Gingrich's attempts to cut social spending, and his
votes on environmental legislation have earned him consistently
weak ratings from national environmental groups.
 
 
   Yet D'Amato is no less nimble than Schumer. The senator voted
for the federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring
against homosexuals; he is poised to win the endorsement of one of
the nation's major gay rights groups, the Human Rights Campaign. He
became one of the chief advocates in Washington of repealing
legislation passed by a Republican Congress (with his support) that
curbed benefits to the children of illegal immigrants.
 
 
   On Sunday, he spoke before one of the largest black
congregations in New York City at the church in Queens led by a
former congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, where he recounted his
efforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.
 
 
   He is planning to testify in Washington on Tuesday about ways to
curb acid rain. And he has pushed consistently and successfully for
spending on breast cancer research and screening.
 
 
   As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidates
suggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race in
New York. The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined with
the diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, means
that being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift that
it once was. Yet New York remains a long way from being a
conservative state.
 
 
   In the end, the best evidence of where these two candidates
stand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week by
District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New
York City employees. What was surprising was not that this
historically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that it
anguished so much over it all.
 
 
   ``There are differences between them,'' said Norman Adler, the
political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats. ``But
on the whole, they are less different than you would like to
think.''
