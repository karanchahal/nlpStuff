NEW YORK _ Anyone following the U.S. Senate race in New Yorkthis year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of theepic ideological battles of the 1990s: the right-wing extremist,Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn congressman,Charles Schumer.On one side is D'Amato, who, as Schumer said again Sunday, votedto cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battledenvironmentalists. On the other is Schumer, who, as D'Amato likesto say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions andsupported a series of tax increases.But the truth behind these ideological caricatures isconsiderably more complex, despite the best efforts of Schumer andD'Amato to confuse it. These two candidates for Senate are, infact, political hybrids, masters of the fluid school of politicsand ideology that has emerged in U.S. elections in the 1990s, andvery much in the tradition of such successful politicians as BillClinton, Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki.Like Clinton, who campaigned in the New Hampshire Democraticprimary in 1992 on a promise to slash welfare, and Pataki, who ranfor New York governor in 1994 by embracing the environmentalmovement, D'Amato and Schumer have defied just enough of theirparties' orthodoxy to resist easy characterization.Their legislative histories are certainly littered with votesthat permit their opponents to paint them as extreme, likeSchumer's voting in the state Assembly to weaken drug laws, orD'Amato's championing of much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich'sContract With America. But like most New Yorkers _ or morespecifically, like most people who will vote on Nov. 3 _ thethree-term Republican senator and his Democratic challenger arecloser to the center than to either extreme.``I do not think they are as different as they say,'' said theRev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who ran for theDemocratic nomination to challenge D'Amato in 1992. ``Chuck hasalways been right of center in the Democratic Party, and D'Amatohas always been, well, whatever works for him on that given day.They are both rewriting as they go.''The flood of conflicting vote citations and ideologicalname-calling that have filled the state's airwaves notwithstanding,these first three weeks of the general election campaign have beenless about ideology and more about tactics. With a nod to thepolitical reality of the moderate cast of New York's electorate,D'Amato and Schumer are each trying to accomplish the same thing,if from different corners of the ring: to cover the tracks of theirown political evolution while portraying their opponent as extreme.This maneuvering began on the first day of the general electioncampaign as D'Amato attacked Schumer as liberal while therepresentative assailed D'Amato as soft on crime. And it hascontinued every day since then, testimony to one of the mostenduring facts of this contest: Whatever their differences onissues, as political tacticians, Schumer and D'Amato have similarreflexes.This is nothing new for D'Amato. He has historically preparedfor each election with a march on the political center, and thencampaigned by portraying his opponents, notably Robert Abrams, thestate attorney general, in 1992, as liberal vestiges. This formula,combined with a record of tending to the more parochial needs ofthe state and its voters, largely accounts for D'Amato's repeatedsuccess at winning re-election in what is, by registration, astrongly Democratic state.What is different this time is that D'Amato has encountered inSchumer a challenger who is trying to do to the senator what thesenator typically does to his opponent. The representative hasparried each ideological assault by D'Amato by asserting that it isthe senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurringhis own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his ownmarch on the political center as he prepared in Congress for thisrace.It seems unlikely that Schumer will ever convince voters that heis, for example, tougher on crime than D'Amato, or that D'Amato isa foot soldier for Gingrich's Republican revolution. But at thevery least, by echoing D'Amato's tactics, Schumer may succeed inneutralizing a weapon that D'Amato has used against previousopponents to devastating effect.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnD'Amato certainly has a basis for saying that Schumer is to theleft of most of the U.S. electorate. Schumer voted against the 1996bill that restricted welfare benefits. He opposed thebalanced-budget amendment. He has supported a series of taxincreases over the years. He voted for federal legislation thatwould ban discrimination in hiring homosexuals. He has votedagainst measures that would make it easier to jail juveniles inadult prisons, and against another measure that would have imposedadditional penalties for crimes involving the use of guns.But Schumer, who has spent many of his 18 years in Congresspreparing for the seven weeks of this general election campaign,has also repeatedly voted in favor of a federal death penalty.(Though Schumer earlier in his life opposed the death penalty.) Hewas the sponsor of legislation to provide funds to hire policeofficers and to ban many forms of assault weapons. He voted torestrict the rights of illegal immigrants in some cases, and infavor of legislation to crack down on food-stamp fraud. Hesupported the line-item veto. He also voted in favor of a measurethat would ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.Similarly, on many levels, D'Amato's Republican credentials seemmore than secure. He has opposed abortion rights throughout hiscareer, and voted against gun control. He has supported manyaspects of Gingrich's attempts to cut social spending, and hisvotes on environmental legislation have earned him consistentlyweak ratings from national environmental groups.Yet D'Amato is no less nimble than Schumer. The senator votedfor the federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiringagainst homosexuals; he is poised to win the endorsement of one ofthe nation's major gay rights groups, the Human Rights Campaign. Hebecame one of the chief advocates in Washington of repealinglegislation passed by a Republican Congress (with his support) thatcurbed benefits to the children of illegal immigrants.On Sunday, he spoke before one of the largest blackcongregations in New York City at the church in Queens led by aformer congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, where he recounted hisefforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.He is planning to testify in Washington on Tuesday about ways tocurb acid rain. And he has pushed consistently and successfully forspending on breast cancer research and screening.As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidatessuggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race inNew York. The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined withthe diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, meansthat being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift thatit once was. Yet New York remains a long way from being aconservative state.In the end, the best evidence of where these two candidatesstand could be found in the endorsement by Schumer last week byDistrict Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing NewYork City employees. What was surprising was not that thishistorically solid Democratic union endorsed Schumer but that itanguished so much over it all.``There are differences between them,'' said Norman Adler, thepolitical consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats. ``Buton the whole, they are less different than you would like tothink.''
