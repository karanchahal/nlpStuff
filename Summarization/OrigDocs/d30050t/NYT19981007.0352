Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer are locked in anextraordinarily tight race for the U.S. Senate. The outcomeapparently rests with a small group of undecided voters, many ofwhom are not yet paying attention to the contest, a statewide NewYork Times/CBS News Poll has found.With a month to go until the election, the poll found a largenumber of respondents _ 60 percent _ either had no opinion aboutSchumer, or did not know enough about him to offer an opinion. Atthe same time, a sizable number of voters continue to voicereservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology, including manyundecided voters and some respondents who identified themselves asthe senator's supporters.The findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the New Yorkcontest in its final weeks: a struggle by both camps to defineSchumer's public personality among voters who do not know him, andan attempt by Schumer to exploit the obvious and strong liabilitiesD'Amato carries as a three-term Republican senator in New York.In some ways, this closely watched contest is shaping up as areplay of the 1992 Senate race, when D'Amato ran against RobertAbrams, the former state attorney general. A Times poll in thethird week of October 1992 found D'Amato in an effective tie withhis Democratic challenger. D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by asingle percentage point after a searing campaign.But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to a number of waysin which this contest is different from 1992, and that is notnecessarily good news for D'Amato. An equal number of voters nowview D'Amato and Schumer as being serious when it comes to dealingwith crime, evidence that the nine-term Brooklyn congressman hasachieved some success in neutralizing a traditionally Republicanissue.While D'Amato continues to be widely viewed as ``the kind ofperson who gets things done for the voters'' _ clearly one of hisbiggest political advantages going into the last couple of months _a substantial number of respondents said he was lacking in honestyand integrity, and that he did not care ``about the needs andproblems of people like you.'' Schumer scored strongly on bothmeasures.And perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derailSchumer's campaign with a series of attacks these past three weeks_ from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he hasmissed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year _ hasyet to show obvious effect on the public's view of the congressman.Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating ofSchumer, compared to 22 percent who had a favorable rating. Bycontrast, in a poll conducted in the third week of October of 1992,Abrams was viewed unfavorably by one in three voters.In the current poll, D'Amato is viewed favorably by 27 percentand unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually the same marks he receivedsix years ago.By almost every measure that pollsters use to try to analyze anelection _ registered voters, likely voters, and taking intoaccount how undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward _ thiscontest is a dead heat.Among registered voters, Schumer is supported by 44 percent,compared to 41 percent for D'Amato. There were 12 percentundecided. Among those respondents considered most likely to vote,based on their past behavior and current level of interest in thecontest, the margin is 47 percent for Schumer to 43 percent forD'Amato.The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted fromlast Thursday through Tuesday with 1,461 adults, of whom 1,066 saidthey were registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error ofplus or minus three points. Therefore, among registered voters,Schumer could be ahead by as much as nine points _ or D'Amato couldbe ahead by three points.
