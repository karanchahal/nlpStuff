WASHINGTON _ Almost every member of the House JudiciaryCommittee paid some tribute to the Constitution and the FoundingFathers Monday. Many said portentously that their debates and voteswould be remembered for generations. The muse of history wasobviously working overtime.True, it was only the third time that presidential impeachmenthas been formally considered on Capitol Hill. But only in thatlimited sense was the approval of a full-scale impeachment processhistoric. It was by no means decisive, no matter how much thelegislators huffed and puffed.This was only a first step along a rocky road whose length isnot known _ not by President Clinton, not by the public and noteven by committee members (although the chairman, Rep. Henry J.Hyde, R-Ill., said last weekend that he hoped the House ofRepresentatives could finish its work before year's end).``The Constitution provides our compass,'' said Rep. EdwardPease, R-Ind. ``I intend to follow it.'' But neither he nor hiscolleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed aquarter-century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.This case is about law-breaking, they said, and not about illicitsex. To which Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee'ssenior Democrat, retorted: ``This is not about Watergate. It isabout an extramarital affair.''That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the twoparties.People in Washington universally assume that the House as awhole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.The Republicans have the votes to prevail. But if only Republicanssupport the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as wasthe case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seenby many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.If only a half-dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image oftrench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry willbegin under something of a cloud; if 50 or 75 do so, the vote willconfer a greater degree of legitimacy.The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans areganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the betterhis chances of surviving.Of course, consensus or something approaching it may developlater. Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers ofRepublican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon hadcommitted impeachable offenses. The fact that they finally did ledpeople on both sides to judge its actions fair.In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnsonsurvived a Senate trial because just enough members of theopposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift tothe midterm elections on Nov. 3. The conventional wisdom inWashington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in thedays before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changeswould be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion thatDemocratic losses would be large, which took hold in the daysbefore the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred byreleasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginalHouse Democrats.Two caveats seem in order, however. While the president'stroubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats werein big trouble in those without any drag from Washington. A numberof independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 ormore seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats donot.``Differential turnouts aren't really very common, you know,''said a senior Republican senator on Capitol Hill. ``But this year,Democratic voters seem to be in a sulk, and the Republicans actlike they'd turn out even if it snowed on Election Day.''Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuitof Clinton. But the political terrain is tricky. After November,both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate _ larger,spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intenselypartisan _ and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal ofthe Republicans in Congress.The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and howit is developed, will have an impact as well. Unshakeable as thepreconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experiencesuggests that over a long period, some of them and some others inthe House will change their minds.If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, theirdeportment will certainly influence some representatives. How theyand their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break downhis testimony would run the risk of alienating people who wouldsense disrespect for the presidency.A foreign crisis _ a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to onethat the administration was suspected of inventing _ couldradically change the context of the inquiry, too. Republicans mightfind themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chieffrom important security responsibilities.And what of the topics other than Ms. Lewinsky that Starr hasinvestigated? Hyde insisted Monday night that the independentcounsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and othercontroversies; one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep.Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would beforthcoming from Starr. Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling; wrappingup the other cases would take some of the steam out of the Houseinquiry.All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in theair as the House debates impeachment in November and December.Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might ormight not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committeevote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment,before ratification by the House as a whole.At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decideto resign. Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee hadvoted. But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence morethan the vote itself, plus the belief he could not win in theSenate.Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson,surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second RichardNixon. As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chanceof getting the 34 votes he would need (one-third of the total plusone) to win a Senate trial.But that is not chiseled in stone, either. The Republicans couldhave 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate. In thatcase, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of onlyseven Democrats would doom Clinton. A remote possibility,certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in thiscase seemed highly improbable until it happened.
