WASHINGTON _ For all the talk of duty and Constitution, it wasnot all that difficult for the House to open a formal impeachmentinquiry into President Clinton Thursday. The more troublesomequestion is how Congress will bring to a conclusion the processthat Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called ``this venture, thisexcursion, this journey.''The conventional wisdom, which Democrats have clung to acrossthese tumultuous weeks for their party, is that the less impulsiveSenate will never accumulate the votes to convict Clinton, and thatinescapable fact will finally force some kind of a deal between thepresident and the Republicans.``The president is going to remain in office,'' pronounced Rep.James Moran, D-Va. ``That's a foregone conclusion.''But conventional wisdom has often been wrong in this strangepolitical year dominated by Clinton's relationship with MonicaLewinsky, and intense causes sometimes take on a life and momentumof their own on Capitol Hill.Many House members _ including some Republicans _ fear thathaving opened Pandora's box Thursday, they will never get it closedagain without first moving through impeachment of the president anda Senate trial that could consume Congress for another year.``It feels like it's out of control,'' said Rep. ChristopherShays, R-Conn. ``Everything's set in motion, and I don't know howyou put it back in the box.''This sense of riding a runaway train could diminish if aftermonths of deliberations and gathering evidence, the Congress andthe country jointly come to a national conclusion that Clintonshould be impeached, tried and removed from office, like theconsensus that Richard Nixon faced when he resigned.The risk is that Congress could rush ahead without brakes evenas the American people continue to resist the idea that Clintonshould be ousted over the Lewinsky affair. ``This has the potentialto be the most divisive issue in American public life since theVietnam War,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.Two sharply different schools of thought co-exist on CapitolHill about how the president's fate will be determined. Which oneprevails could well be decided by the outcome of the elections justthree and a half weeks away, unless Kenneth Starr, the independentcounsel, changes all the political calculations by forwarding toCongress new allegations of impeachable offenses.Under the first outcome, the Republicans make only modest gainsin November. They decide they have wrung maximum politicaladvantage out of Clinton's misconduct and that prolongedimpeachment hearings could hurt them going into the 2000presidential elections. And for a brief window of time, thepressure to appease the party's conservative base would be off.``I would say now that if nothing more comes out and there is nodramatic changes of seats in the House and the Senate, this will beresolved short of impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. ``Ifthe elections stalemate, that will be a signal from the Americanpeople not to do impeachment, but to do something.''The alternate script could play out if the Republicans makestrong inroads in November. Many Republicans have already signaledtheir deep belief that Clinton has committed perjury, obstructedjustice, and placed himself above the laws that he has sworn touphold.One of their loudest voices, that of the House majority whip,accused Democrats Thursday of seeking ``the path of leastresistance. This is when we pitch the law overboard when the moodfits,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ``when we ignore the facts inorder to cover up the truth.''For such Republicans an election sweep would be read as a strongmandate to move forward with actual impeachment. And it could causeDemocratic unity to crack, putting the president in even morejeopardy.Still, Democrats on Thursday were adamant that their fewdefections on the inquiry vote mean that they are likely to standunited against actual impeachment. ``If Republicans are only ableto pick off 15 percent of our members on a procedural vote threeweeks before an election, how many votes are they likely to getfour months from now on articles of impeachment?'' asked oneDemocratic strategist.For now, the inquiry is likely to go on hold until after theelections. Hyde said no hearings would be convened until later inNovember. But battles are already brewing between the two partiesover how to conduct the investigation.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnHyde has said he sees little reason to bring Ms. Lewinskyforward in public hearings, but the Democrats are likely to demandher appearance, adding to the sense of circus on Capitol Hill.``You cannot have impeachment hearings where the star witness isnot called and cross-examined,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.``You have to have Monica Lewinsky testify. You have to have hermother testify. You have to hear from Betty Currie and VernonJordan.'' And Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat onthe Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that Starr would be someonethe Democrats would want in the witness chair.As these events move forward, Clinton's aides would dearly loveto find a way to strike a deal on some punishment short ofimpeachment _ not in the Senate but before the House takes theactual impeachment vote, according to a Democratic strategist closeto the White House.Clinton, who has thought so often about his legacy, is nowfighting not to become the only other president besides AndrewJohnson to be impeached by the House. (Nixon resigned after theHouse Judiciary Committee reported out three articles ofimpeachment and before a House vote.)Gingrich is the figure in the House who would have the statureto broker a deal, and just like Clinton, the speaker has an intenseinterest in how he is perceived in history. But it is far fromclear whether the Georgia Republican _ who presided from thespeaker's chair through the entire House debate _ would have anyinterest in such a role.He has his own personal considerations to weigh. He will bestanding for re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes.His relations with Clinton have ranged from furious to occasionalmoments of alliance, while his relations with House Democrats haveranged from poor to awful. In a rare bipartisan leadership meetingover impeachment last month, he lectured House Democrats that hewould be fairer to Clinton than Democrats were to Gingrich when hisethics troubles resulted in a House reprimand and a $300,000 fine.Still, one House Republican with a good antenna for thespeaker's intentions said that should the politics and timing beright, ``I think he will try to broker a deal. He could come in atjust the right moment and show he's above it all.'' But Rich Galen,a close associate of Gingrich's, said that if the evidence showsthat Clinton committed perjury under oath, ``I don't think thespeaker will think it's his role to get in the way of thatprocess.''
