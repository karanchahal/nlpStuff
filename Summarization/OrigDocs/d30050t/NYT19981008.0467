 
   WASHINGTON _ For all the talk of duty and Constitution, it was
not all that difficult for the House to open a formal impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton Thursday. The more troublesome
question is how Congress will bring to a conclusion the process
that Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called ``this venture, this
excursion, this journey.''
 
 
   The conventional wisdom, which Democrats have clung to across
these tumultuous weeks for their party, is that the less impulsive
Senate will never accumulate the votes to convict Clinton, and that
inescapable fact will finally force some kind of a deal between the
president and the Republicans.
 
 
   ``The president is going to remain in office,'' pronounced Rep.
James Moran, D-Va. ``That's a foregone conclusion.''
 
 
   But conventional wisdom has often been wrong in this strange
political year dominated by Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, and intense causes sometimes take on a life and momentum
of their own on Capitol Hill.
 
 
   Many House members _ including some Republicans _ fear that
having opened Pandora's box Thursday, they will never get it closed
again without first moving through impeachment of the president and
a Senate trial that could consume Congress for another year.
 
 
   ``It feels like it's out of control,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn. ``Everything's set in motion, and I don't know how
you put it back in the box.''
 
 
   This sense of riding a runaway train could diminish if after
months of deliberations and gathering evidence, the Congress and
the country jointly come to a national conclusion that Clinton
should be impeached, tried and removed from office, like the
consensus that Richard Nixon faced when he resigned.
 
 
   The risk is that Congress could rush ahead without brakes even
as the American people continue to resist the idea that Clinton
should be ousted over the Lewinsky affair. ``This has the potential
to be the most divisive issue in American public life since the
Vietnam War,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
 
 
   Two sharply different schools of thought co-exist on Capitol
Hill about how the president's fate will be determined. Which one
prevails could well be decided by the outcome of the elections just
three and a half weeks away, unless Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, changes all the political calculations by forwarding to
Congress new allegations of impeachable offenses.
 
 
   Under the first outcome, the Republicans make only modest gains
in November. They decide they have wrung maximum political
advantage out of Clinton's misconduct and that prolonged
impeachment hearings could hurt them going into the 2000
presidential elections. And for a brief window of time, the
pressure to appease the party's conservative base would be off.
 
 
   ``I would say now that if nothing more comes out and there is no
dramatic changes of seats in the House and the Senate, this will be
resolved short of impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. ``If
the elections stalemate, that will be a signal from the American
people not to do impeachment, but to do something.''
 
 
   The alternate script could play out if the Republicans make
strong inroads in November. Many Republicans have already signaled
their deep belief that Clinton has committed perjury, obstructed
justice, and placed himself above the laws that he has sworn to
uphold.
 
 
   One of their loudest voices, that of the House majority whip,
accused Democrats Thursday of seeking ``the path of least
resistance. This is when we pitch the law overboard when the mood
fits,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, ``when we ignore the facts in
order to cover up the truth.''
 
 
   For such Republicans an election sweep would be read as a strong
mandate to move forward with actual impeachment. And it could cause
Democratic unity to crack, putting the president in even more
jeopardy.
 
 
   Still, Democrats on Thursday were adamant that their few
defections on the inquiry vote mean that they are likely to stand
united against actual impeachment. ``If Republicans are only able
to pick off 15 percent of our members on a procedural vote three
weeks before an election, how many votes are they likely to get
four months from now on articles of impeachment?'' asked one
Democratic strategist.
 
 
   For now, the inquiry is likely to go on hold until after the
elections. Hyde said no hearings would be convened until later in
November. But battles are already brewing between the two parties
over how to conduct the investigation.
 
 
 
   Hyde has said he sees little reason to bring Ms. Lewinsky
forward in public hearings, but the Democrats are likely to demand
her appearance, adding to the sense of circus on Capitol Hill.
 
 
   ``You cannot have impeachment hearings where the star witness is
not called and cross-examined,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass.
``You have to have Monica Lewinsky testify. You have to have her
mother testify. You have to hear from Betty Currie and Vernon
Jordan.'' And Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the senior Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, said Thursday that Starr would be someone
the Democrats would want in the witness chair.
 
 
   As these events move forward, Clinton's aides would dearly love
to find a way to strike a deal on some punishment short of
impeachment _ not in the Senate but before the House takes the
actual impeachment vote, according to a Democratic strategist close
to the White House.
 
 
   Clinton, who has thought so often about his legacy, is now
fighting not to become the only other president besides Andrew
Johnson to be impeached by the House. (Nixon resigned after the
House Judiciary Committee reported out three articles of
impeachment and before a House vote.)
 
 
   Gingrich is the figure in the House who would have the stature
to broker a deal, and just like Clinton, the speaker has an intense
interest in how he is perceived in history. But it is far from
clear whether the Georgia Republican _ who presided from the
speaker's chair through the entire House debate _ would have any
interest in such a role.
 
 
   He has his own personal considerations to weigh. He will be
standing for re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes.
His relations with Clinton have ranged from furious to occasional
moments of alliance, while his relations with House Democrats have
ranged from poor to awful. In a rare bipartisan leadership meeting
over impeachment last month, he lectured House Democrats that he
would be fairer to Clinton than Democrats were to Gingrich when his
ethics troubles resulted in a House reprimand and a $300,000 fine.
 
 
   Still, one House Republican with a good antenna for the
speaker's intentions said that should the politics and timing be
right, ``I think he will try to broker a deal. He could come in at
just the right moment and show he's above it all.'' But Rich Galen,
a close associate of Gingrich's, said that if the evidence shows
that Clinton committed perjury under oath, ``I don't think the
speaker will think it's his role to get in the way of that
process.''
