BEIJING _ In a pointed speech delivered to Communist Partymembers in the Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin madeclear Friday that China's economic reforms were not a prelude toWestern-style multiparty democracy and that those who challengedthe party's supremacy would be quashed.Officially, the speech was intended to commemorate the 20thanniversary of the Communist Party meeting that marked thebeginning of the reforms. But it also provided a vigorous, ifindirect, defense of the government's recent decision to try threeof the country's most prominent democracy activists on criminalcharges for their efforts to organize an opposition politicalparty.The trials of Wang Youcai and Qin Youming opened on Thursday.They are accused of inciting subversion of the state, charges thatcarry a minimum prison sentence of five years on conviction,although neither trial has come to a verdict.And Friday the family of China's most senior dissident, XuWenli, another organizer of the opposition party, was told that hewould stand trial on Monday, facing an even more serious charge ofsubverting state power, which could bring a sentence of lifeimprisonment.Xu has been detained since Nov. 30, after the police raided hishouse and confiscated documents about the new opposition group, theChina Democratic Party.While vowing to move ahead with economic reforms, Jiang's speechwas more conservative politically than others he has made thisyear. Again and again he invoked Communist Party dogma, usingphrases rarely uttered in the last year, like the ``four cardinalprinciples.'' Those state that the leadership of the CommunistParty, adherence to the socialist path and the upholding of MaoZedong Thought and of Marxism-Leninism must serve as the foundationfor the country.During President Clinton's state visit in the summer, the worldsaw President Jiang, agile international political leader, inaction. Friday he was once again General Secretary Jiang, CommunistParty stalwart.China's current political system ``must not be shaken, weakenedor discarded at any time,'' Jiang said, adding, ``The Western modeof political systems must never be copied.''Later he said, ``We must be vigilant against infiltration,subversive activities and separatist activities of internationaland domestic hostile forces.'' China must ``fight against factorsdisrupting social stability and nip them in the bud,'' he said.Jiang's remarks on these topics echoed points made two weeks agoby Li Peng, the former prime minister who now heads the NationalPeople's Congress, in a rare interview with the German businessnewspaper Handelsblatt.Li is usually associated with the more conservative faction ofthe party. But Friday, as China is facing harsh criticism fromhuman rights groups and Western governments over its treatment ofthe China Democratic Party's leaders, the same admonitions camedirectly from Jiang.Jiang also said China should not rely too heavily on foreigncountries to boost its economic development, and he acknowledgedthat the party had made some ``mistakes'' that had left citizensdissatisfied. Presumably that was a reference to the millions oflayoffs caused by a shift toward a market economy, and to theresulting demonstrations that have become commonplace in smallerChinese cities.But it was, at heart, a back-to-basics talk, a reminder thateven though many of China's citizens wear tailored suits and totecellular phones, and even though its billboard-lined thoroughfaresresemble streets in the West, the country remains a one-partydictatorship.Earlier this year, the founding members of the China DemocraticParty, a small, loose network of activists from all over thecountry, hoped that there might be room for political opposition.Heartened by the relatively open discourse that surrounded theClinton visit and later by China's decision to sign theInternational Convention on Civil and Political Rights, thedissidents have repeatedly tried to register their fledgling partyas a government-recognized social organization.In the last two months, the official response has moved quicklyfrom neglect, to polite rebuff, to detention, to this week'strials.It is unclear what will happen to the three men being tried orthe many other Democratic Party members who have been detained asthey have sought to protest the criminal proceedings.At the trials of Wang in Hang-zhou and Qin in Wuhan, neither manwas represented by a lawyer, although allowed by Chinese law,because prospective lawyers were intimidated or detained by localofficials, their families said.In a two-and-a-half-hour court session Friday, Wang defendedhimself. No defense has yet been presented for Qin.Xu, who will go on trial on Monday in Beijing, has been given acourt-appointed lawyer, his wife said. Xu has already spent morethan 10 years in prison. His indictment accuses him of organizingthe China Democratic Party, accepting money from abroad, callingfor independent trade unions and making subversive statements ininterviews with foreign news organizations.&QL;
