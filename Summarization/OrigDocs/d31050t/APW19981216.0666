BEIJING (AP) _ With attorneys locked up, harassed or plainscared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves againstcharges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissidenttrials in two years.Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out ofoptions Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a buddingopposition political party. Qin's family pleaded for a postponementat Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials deniedthe request.Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, andsubtler pressures have been used on others, family members said.Given the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will beconvicted.``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, thegovernment has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said.Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities 500 kilometers(300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only by family and afew observers selected by the courts.Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion ofstate power, apparently for helping to organize the China DemocracyParty. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convictedunder the harshest aspects of the law.By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, theruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination tocrush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities havedetained or questioned more than 30 people associated with theparty in a 17-day-old crackdown.Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a studentleader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are amongthe most active and influential members of China's dissidentcommunity. A third prominent member of the dissident community, XuWenli, was also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged.To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, policehave detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city ofHangzhou, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported. The InformationCenter of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said manymore are missing and believed to be in custody.To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal rightsguaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders, hiswife said.``Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I wasdoing this, some people were doing things to stop me,'' Hu Jiangxiasaid.During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a policeofficial stormed in and said, ```Don't do anything for them. Don'ttake this case. Whoever takes the case, you can't win,''' Hurecounted.Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother QinXiaoguang said. The Information Center said one lawyer whoinitially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for fourhours and then called Qin's family to withdraw.Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued overwhether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his fatherhave decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but anotherbrother will go.Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter toChina's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing forfair trials, the Information Center said. It added that authoritiesviolated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin haveadequate representation.The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstratingthe appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China DemocracyParty.Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others inHangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities haverefused their applications to register the party as required bylaw.Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put ontrial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. Hewas convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-yearsentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.
