BEIJING (AP) _ China released a respected, but ailing laborrights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediatelysent him into exile in the United States.Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by thegovernment to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcomingtrial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli.Xu is the third leading member of a would-be oppositionpolitical party put on trial for subversion in a three-weekcrackdown that has seen 30 dissidents arrested or interrogated.Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groupsdecried the Chinese government's timing as manipulative.``We don't want to give any credit to the Chinese government forthis cynical game it is playing,'' said Xiao Qiang, director of NewYork-based Human Rights in China.After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe laborcamp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airportand put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York,his mother and brother said.Accompanying Liu into exile was his wife, Chu Hailan, and their11-year-old daughter, the family said.Liu Nianchun's release follows the same pattern China used infreeing its two most famous dissidents, Wei Jingsheng in Nov. 1997and Wang Dan in April. Authorities released Liu on medical parole,exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provided hego into exile, Liu Qing said.Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.In an exam authorities finally agreed to provide last month,doctors discovered Liu had tumors in his mouth, stomach and bowels,Liu Qing said.Like Wang and Wei, the United States and other Westerngovernments have lobbied China to release Liu. Chinese leaders havebeen forcing well-known dissidents into exile throughout the 1990s,finding that once abroad they lose their influence among dissidentsat home.In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua NewsAgency reported that judicial departments took into account Liu'shealth and behavior in the labor camp in approving his parole formedical treatment.``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sendingpeople directly from prison into exile is a type of human rightsviolation and persecution,'' Liu Qing said in a telephone interviewfrom his home in New York's Brooklyn borough.Liu Nianchun was one of the most respected figures in thefractured, persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2years in prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the wayChina's Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.Liu was imprisoned three times in the past 17 years. His lastarrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights inMay 1995. Liu was never put on trial. Fourteen months passed beforehis wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his fate and whereabouts: athree-year spell in a labor camp in the frigid, remote northeast.His term was the maximum police may impose on criminal suspectswithout trial. Labor camp officials later extended Liu's sentenceby a year for trying to escape, a charge Chu claimed wasfabricated.Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike toprotest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle prods and confinedto a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could onlysit or stand.His wife fearlessly endured police harassment, beatings anddetentions in campaigning for his release. Chu was dragged away andhit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to U.N.human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel inSeptember.
