BEIJING (AP) _ China's government said Thursday that twoprominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected ofendangering national security _ the clearest sign yet Chineseleaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify whatlaws were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered thestate.A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who hasbeen in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``incitingthe overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based InformationCenter of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.All three men could face up to life in prison if convicted ofthe harshest measures under China's vague state security law. Theruling Communist Party has resorted to the law to silence dissentsince it went into effect last year.The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and theaccusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chineseleaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up andlegally register the China Democracy Party in June.Xu and Qin were ``suspected of involvement in activitiesendangering state security'' and their ``behavior breached relevantprovisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic ofChina,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing.Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday thatcharges have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him astep closer to trial, the Information Center said.Xu and Qin are influential figures in the dissident community,having started their campaign for change 20 years ago in theseminal Democracy Wall movement. Wang was a student leader in the1989 Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations. Both have servedtime in prison. Xu spent 12 years in jail, much of it in solitaryconfinement.Since dissidents began organizing and trying to legally registerthe China Democracy Party, police have harassed and brieflydetained more than two dozen members, but until now the governmenthad not leveled such politically charged allegations.The Communist Party has never allowed another political party toform since it took power in 1949.In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhartsaid the United States deplored the arrests and said thedissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental humanrights that all governments should protect.U.S. officials conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministryof Foreign Affairs and urged that Xu and Qin be releasedimmediately.Zhu criticized the United States for condemning the arrests,saying that ``no country, including the United States, shouldinterfere in China's internal affairs.''China in October signed a key U.N. treaty on civil and politicalrights that guarantees freedom of expression and freedom ofassociation. It was the 17th international human rights treatyChina has signed.Zhu told reporters there was ``absolutely no contradiction atall'' between China's support for these treaties and its arrests ofthe two dissidents.
