BEIJING (AP) _ China's central government ordered the arrest ofa prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts withexiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming nationalsecurity, a colleague said Wednesday.Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguoto stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoringthe warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be releasedsoon and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,''Zha said.Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrestedMonday night in police raids in two cities that delivered thesternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish theChina Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party'smonopoly on power.Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, acrime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Partyadvocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was alsoformally arrested Monday although his family has not been informedof the charges.Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijingand the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu'sarrest was ordered by the central government, not Beijing police.He took the police reference to ``reactionary groups'' to meanexiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's vague StateSecurity Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life inprison.Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in theUnited States to campaign ``to save Xu Wenli.''On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded inan open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai,saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties Chinahas signed over the past 14 months.The authorities ``are deceiving and cheating internationalpublic opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing andpersecuting domestic political dissidents,'' said the letter faxedto foreign news agencies.In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said theUnited States deplored the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin.``We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind andother forms of peaceful expression that they've been involved inare fundamental human rights that should be protected by allgovernments,'' Lockart said. ``We call on the Chinese government toassure the protection in these cases of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin.''State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. officialsconveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairsand urged that Xu be released immediately.U.S. officials received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is beingdetained on suspicion of ``having conducted activities damaging toChina's national security,'' Rubin said.He said he had no information from Chinese authorities about Qinor Wang.Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody incentral Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang_ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli'swife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party aswell as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissidentcommunity. Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wallmovement of the 1970s. Wang was a student leader in 1989'sinfluential Tiananmen Square democracy movement. All have spenttime in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of it in solitaryconfinement.Xu's wife said she does not know where he is being held and, inher 20-year experience with the authorities, believes they areunlikely to tell her.Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for politicalchange soon after his parole ended last year. He has tried to useChina's nascent legal system and the international treaties itsigned to push for reform.``My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can becriticized for,'' said his wife, He Xintong. ``They're going tohave to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal.''
