BEIJING _ One leader of a suppressed new political party will betried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies ofChina ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according tocourt documents given to his wife on Monday.The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of theChina Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious theCommunist authorities are in their campaign to destroy thefledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak outover the last year.The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almostcertainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five yearsor more. Wang, 32, has been imprisoned in his home city, Hangzhouin eastern China, for a month, but was not formally arrested untilNov. 30. On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters ofthe new party, were detained.One, Qin Yongmin, 45, of the central city of Wuhan, and theother, Xu Wenli, 55, of Beijing, are being held on suspicion ofsubversive activities. Detailed charges have not been filed.Wang was a student leader in the pro-democracy demonstrations inTiananmen Square in 1989. After the army had crushed the movement,Wang was arrested and served two years in prison.Qin and Xu became known as democracy advocates in the late1970s. Qin was imprisoned for eight years. In 1993 he was put in alabor camp for two years. Xu spent 12 years in prison.When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced theformation of the Democracy Party. He and other dissidents hopedthat China's new friendship with the United States and its decisionto sign a global covenant on political and civil rights would givethem room to promote political alternatives.After Clinton returned home Wang was detained, warned andreleased, only to be re-arrested as authorities began what nowappears to be a major crackdown on dissent. Monday, Wang's wife, HuJiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution, according to theInformation Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in HongKong.Wang is charged with helping draft a party manifesto thatstates, in part, ``Only by establishing an opposition party can webe rid of this despotism.'' That is cited as grounds for thesubversion charge, the information center said.In addition to detailing Wang's organizing activities, theprosecutors charge that he colluded with enemies of the stateabroad, making his crime far more serious under Chinese law.He used e-mail to send 18 copies of the party's foundingdocuments abroad, met with a member of a subversive foreignorganization and received money from foreign sources to buy acomputer, the indictment reportedly says.
