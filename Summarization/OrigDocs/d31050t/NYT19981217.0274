BEIJING _ The separate trials of two prominent democracyadvocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursdaymorning, with the families of both defendants protesting theirinability to hire defense lawyers.The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32,founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, wasin session for just two hours and 10 minutes. It appears to befinished, although the court did not announce a decision or saywhen it would.``I don't know what happens from here,'' said Wang's wife, HuJiangxia, who was one of three relatives allowed to attend thetrial. ``I don't hold much hope,'' she added in a telephoneinterview.Wang, who spent two years in prison after the 1989 studentdemonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was accused of organizing apolitical party that sought to overturn Communist Party rule and ofcolluding with foreign enemies of the state. He could face fiveyears or more in prison.Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated bysecurity agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defenseThursday morning after prosecutors laid out their case. But thejudge frequently interrupted him and cut him off after half anhour, saying he was not responding to the specific facts of thecase, she added.Wang argued that his activities were legal under China'sconstitution and under an international covenant on politicalrights that China has signed, Ms. Hu said.In the central city of Wuhan, the trial on similar charges ofQin Yongmin, 45, a veteran dissident, also continued for somethingover two hours. It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father,Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecutionpresented its charges.In that case, too, prospective lawyers had been intimidated ordetained, family members said. The elderly father's request to thecourt Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored, so he andone of the defendant's brothers stayed outside the court buildingin protest, leaving another brother inside.``We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the trialbecause if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then as faras we were concerned the proceedings were meaningless,'' the fathersaid by telephone.The U.S. Embassy asked to observe the trials. When an embassyofficial arrived at the court in Hangzhou Thursday morning, he wastold that there were no seats available and instead waited outside,greeting Ms. Hu when she emerged, shaken, from the brief trial.
