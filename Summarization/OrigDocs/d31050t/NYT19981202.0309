BEIJING _ In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chineseofficials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest thisweek of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an oppositionpolitical party.``Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging tonational security and has violated relevant criminal codes of thePeople's Republic of China,'' said a statement from the ForeignMinistry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest.The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as severalother activists involved with him in trying to form the ChinaDemocratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups,other Chinese dissidents and Washington.``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamentalfreedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as aserious step in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesmanJames P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. &UR;  &LR;  U.S. officials inBeijing urged the government to release Xu and asked forclarification as to the exact nature of his crime.China signed the International Covenant of Civil and PoliticalRights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen byhuman rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to itstenets.Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with morethan a dozen activists around the country announcing that theywould begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the ChinaDemocratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home inWuhan on Monday.Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese governmentprotesting the detentions, said the Information Center for HumanRights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained onMonday, although two of them were released early Wednesday.But the two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely toface a much longer haul since both have been charged with``criminal acts.''Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had stillnot been informed of the specific charge against her husband,although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arrestingofficers that the sentence ``could be long.''Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting tosubvert the government,'' a crime that for serious offensescommands sentences of three years to life.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab-bagsection called ``threatening state security,'' which makes almostany political activity that questions or hampers the authority ofthe Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolentactivities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.''Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their effortsto gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose networkof pro-democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around Chinathat was formed this year.In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressiveand defiant in their attempts to register the party with thegovernment, submitting repeated applications even after localauthorities had declared the concept of an opposition partyillegal. They say the Chinese Constitution does not specificallyforbid the formation of new political parties, although there havebeen no new parties since the founding of the People's Republic in1949.In fact, the by-laws of the China Democratic Party are fairlytame; they carefully acknowledge the central role of the CommunistParty, but also support free speech and free elections for publicofficials.``My husband thought the time was right to begin working to forma new party, since China recently signed the covenant on humanrights,'' Ms. He said. In September, a few Democratic Party membersgot some slightly encouraging signals from local governments, whichinitially accepted their applications to form a social organizationto develop a party. But in recent weeks, as organizers like Xubecame more insistent and defiant, harassment by the policeincreased.``All this past week we felt something was going to happen,''Ms. He said. ``It seemed that anyone who came to visit us was laterdetained for a while. And there have been a lot more cars from thePublic Security Bureau parked outside than is usual.''
