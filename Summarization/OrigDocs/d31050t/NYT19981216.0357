BEIJING &UR;  &LR; _ Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the fatherof a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversiontrial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan.The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who hasspent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promotedan alternative, non-Communist political party.In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, QinQinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand thecourt a written plea for postponement. If the plea is ignored, hesaid he will walk out.``I wouldn't be able to stand it,'' the father, a retiredsteelworker, said, citing his frail health and high blood pressure.Under China's code of criminal procedure, a defendant has theright to a defense lawyer. But in this case, the elder Qin said,some lawyers he approached declined to take the case, while otherswere warned by security officials not to get involved.The father said he did not agree with his son's politicaltactics but now he felt he had no choice but to protest histreatment.Qin Yongmin was arrested on Nov. 30, only hours after his motherdied of a stroke.``He wasn't even allowed to attend the funeral,'' Qin Qinguosaid. ``And now he's not allowed to find a lawyer.''On Thursday morning, a few hundred miles to the east in the cityof Hangzhou, Wang Youcai, 33, is to go on trial on similar chargesof inciting subversion. He, too, has no defense lawyer.Wang was a leader of student demonstrations in Tiananmen Squarein 1989 and served two years in prison after they were put down bymilitary force.As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the ChinaDemocracy Party, he publicly announced its charter in June duringPresident Clinton's visit to China.Scores of people around the country began to champion the newparty, hopeful that closer ties between China and the UnitedStates, and China's signing of the international covenant onpolitical and civil rights, would mean a looser political climate.But the party was soon declared illegal and many adherents weredetained, at least temporarily. Wang now faces charges that couldland him in prison for five years or more.A third veteran dissident and promoter of the new party, XuWenli, has been detained for weeks in Beijing and is expected toface similar subversion charges.In the last two days, at least 10 Democracy Party members orsupporters in the Hangzhou area have been detained by the policeand others have had their phone lines cut, reported the InformationCenter of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based inHong Kong.
