Unfortunately for residents of the United States, the Leonidstorm on Nov. 17 is expected to begin at 2:43 p.m. Eastern standardtime and is likely to last for only an hour or so.For the United States, therefore, the entire show will be duringdaylight hours and will be invisible, unless unusually brightbolides, or exploding fireballs, flash through the sky.People in East Asia, however, will have ringside seats, and ifskies are clear, they are likely to witness a great meteor displayunder ideal conditions: a dark, moonless night.Although some forecasters predict that there will be an evenbetter Leonid storm the next November _ actually, the secondinstallment of this year's storm _ it will be visible only fromEurope and North Africa.But the storm next month may include some especially brightfireballs, said Joe Rao, a lecturer at New York's HaydenPlanetarium, in an article in the November issue of Sky &AMP; Telescopemagazine.Some meteor enthusiasts and astronomers plan to travel to Asiathis year and to Europe in 1999 to see the events. The next chanceof a really spectacular Leonid show anywhere on Earth will not comefor another century.Although the United States will not be the best vantage pointfor Leonid watching on Nov. 17, people willing to get up a fewhours before dawn on that day and the next may see more meteoritesthan they would on a normal night.The closest approach the Earth will make to the center of themeteoroid swarm is 790,500 miles _ more than three times thedistance of the Moon from the Earth, but many dust fragments arelikely to stray into collisions with the Earth.Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, Calif., who tracks space objects of various kinds,cautioned that spectators in the United States should not expecttoo much.``Some people think the Leonid storm this year will be as goodas the one in 1966, which was the best one this century, but wethink the 1998 shower will be more modest _ perhaps somethingbetween 200 and 5,000 meteors per hour,'' Yeomans said.In 1966, sky watchers clocked a rate of up to 100,000 meteors anhour at the peak of the Leonid storm.For meteor fans, Rao recommends watching the darkest part of theeastern sky from about 1 a.m. until dawn, on both Nov. 17 and 18.``Whatever you do, set that alarm clock,'' he advised. ``Notuntil 2098 or perhaps 2131 will hopes for a Leonid storm again bejustified.''
