LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Satellite operators reported no immediateproblems Tuesday as the Earth passed through the tail of a cometthat peppered the atmosphere with tiny bits of space junk zippingalong at 155,000 mph (250,000 kph).While people around the world watched the beginning of the bestmeteor storm light show in three decades, the U.S. NationalAeronautics and Space Administration and private satellitecompanies rotated their high-tech machinery to face away from theapproaching debris.The Hubble telescope was turned away from the storm to protectlens surfaces. And the crew of Russia's Mir space station plannedto wait out the worst of the storm in their emergency escapevehicle.Most military satellites are built to withstand attack and sohave better protection from the tiny meteors. NASA planned toreposition six of its 22 satellites to present a smaller target.Others were to be powered down for the worst part of the storm.The particles from the tail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle move at 43miles (69 kilometers) per second. Even a small grain can have thedestructive force of a .22-caliber bullet shot at one of theworld's 600-plus satellites, experts say.The debris particles, most no bigger than a grain of sand, canbore holes in solar panels, damage lenses, blast away mirrorcoatings or cause harmful electrical charges.That created a threat to communications, satellite TV broadcastsand military spying.Aerospace Corp. had no reports of trouble as of early thismorning, said company spokesman Greg Hughes, who was on callovernight in case of emergency.An office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,California, that was to orchestrate troubleshooting effortsremained unstaffed during the night.The likelihood of a direct hit was small.``The chances of any one satellite getting smacked by a particleis probably less than one in one thousand, but on the other hand,some of these satellites are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,so you do take whatever precautions you can,'' said Don Yeomans, asenior research scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
