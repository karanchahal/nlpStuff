Chicken Little would love this one. The Earth is hurtling intothe path of a comet called Temple-Tuttle.On Tuesday, the Earth will enter Temple-Tuttle's debris-strewnbackwash and will then, according to many scientists, witness themost intense meteor shower in more than three decades. Thescientists who track Temple-Tuttle do not even call it a shower,they call it a meteor storm. (While visible in Asia, the storm willbe obscured by the sun in North America during its peak hours.)And in the midst of the storm, among millions of particlesmoving at roughly 160,000 miles an hour, will be 600 or so man-madesatellites, which most people in the industrialized world have cometo rely on, wittingly or not, for entertainment, communication andspying on one another.``This is the first time in the life of ourcommunications-oriented world that we have faced an environmentalthreat of this scope,'' said Ian Rowe, chief executive of Crestech,a nonprofit group based in Toronto that will track the storm forthe Canadian and U.S. governments.Rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's beingdisabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower aboutone-3,000th the density of the storm predicted for Tuesday.American consumers felt the impact of a single satellite'smalfunctioning in May, when the failure of Galaxy IV disruptedpager service in much of the nation.If Tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effectscould be even more daunting. The spy satellites that are peeringdown at Saddam Hussein could lose their ability to spot movementsof his troops. Television channels could become static. Thoserelying on satellite navigation could become lost. Corporatenetworks could shut down. Even the international telephone system,which mostly relies on undersea cables, could be crippled. AT&AMP;TCorp. says there are at least 14 countries, mostly in EasternEurope and the former Soviet Union, that can be reached bytelephone only by satellite.The satellite industry, however, and some of the companies thatrely on it, have a different reaction: no big deal.``We don't think this will be much of an issue,'' said DanielMarcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, the world's largest privatesatellite company, which is controlled by the Hughes Electronicsunit of General Motors Corp. ``It should be a nonevent.''And Stephen Stott, director for satellite engineering atIntelsat, the international satellite consortium, said, ``Most ofthe industry is of the opinion that we do not expect any majorproblems.''After all, the odds say that the meteors _ known as the Leonidsbecause they seem to come from the direction of the constellationLeo _ have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world'ssatellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of thesole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from insidea Major League ballpark.In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generallysmaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strongelectrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitivecomponents.So while the big satellite companies play down the threat, theyare still taking steps to protect their property. Deploying acommercial communications satellite can cost around $250 million.The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges facethe oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target. They plan toshut down some systems, to keep operations simple.But Alastair Hamilton, who is responsible for distributing CableNews Network as Turner Broadcasting System's senior vice presidentfor worldwide distribution technology, said some viewers stillmight lose their signal for a few minutes Tuesday as satellitesrecover from short circuits. He added, however, that he could notget too agitated because there is so little he can do.``At the end of the day, the satellites are up there and thereis no way to hide them,'' he said. ``So we're going to really seewhat happens. And the prevailing opinion is that this is not reallysomething that we should be losing a huge amount of sleep over.''That is not quite how Col. Mike Kelly is handling the situation.That is because he works for the owner of about a quarter of theworld's satellites: the U.S. government.As deputy commander of the 50th Operations Group at SchrieverAir Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Kelly helps run about60 Air Force satellites worth about $40 billion. Kelly's chargesprovide navigation services, communications for officials includingthe president, and help in detecting missile launches.While Marcus of Panamsat and Gregory Clark, president of LoralSpace Communications, another big private satellite company, saidthey expected no impact on their services, Kelly is morepessimistic.``I think it's very unlikely that we'll lose a spacecraft on the17th,'' he said. He added, however, ``I think it's probable thatwe'll see some electrical problems that we'll have to recover.''He said that could take anywhere from a few minutes to severaldays. (Kelly's group does not manage any of the optical spysatellites, he said. Those are generally handled by theultra-secretive National Reconnaissance Office, which refused tocomment.)In contrast to the private satellite companies, however, the AirForce, according to Kelly, has decided not to change its normaloperating procedures substantially, except to be especiallywatchful.``We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be,'' Kellysaid. ``If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of thehappiest people in Colorado.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses33 satellite-linked printing plants in the United States. Eachplant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is stillnervous.``It's a crapshoot, you just don't know,'' he said. ``There'snothing more you can do. There's not time. The only thing you coulddo to put yourself in a risk-free situation is to put in aterrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealtwith the phone companies.''The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate witheight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to useterrestrial, or ground-based, communications. But rather than linkdirectly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem,The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for theprinting plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis,director for investor relations for New York Times Co. She addedthat the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was oneof the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed bythe storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jonesspokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled byMotorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federalfiling, though the company declined to discuss the subject.``There is no relevant experience we can use to base anassessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause tolow-earth-orbit satellites,'' the Iridium filing said, referring tothe sort of satellites it uses. ``But such damage could besignificant.''But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit isone in 5,000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, asRowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide truepeace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.``In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of thenight and get away with it,'' he said, by way of analogy. ``But youmight get K.O.'d by a truck.''
