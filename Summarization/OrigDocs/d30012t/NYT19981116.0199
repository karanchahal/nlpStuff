By the time the earth collides with a dense swarm of meteoroidsTuesday night to unleash what may be the heaviest meteorbombardment since 1966, many orbiting satellites will havemaneuvered into positions facing away from the storm to avoiddamage.But scores of instruments on the ground and aboard airplaneswill be aimed right at the blazing trails left by the meteors,gathering information about these visitors from space and what theydo to the upper atmosphere as they burn up.Astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists and others have beenreadying their experiments for a year or more in preparation forTuesday night's expected Leonid Meteor storm, so named because themeteors appear to be coming from the direction of the constellationLeo. The meteors are fragments, most of them microscopic in size,of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.Although the earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on aboutthis date, only once in approximately every 33 years does the earthintersect the swarm at a crowded point in the wake of the cometafter the comet has made its closest approach to the sun.This year scientists expect many Leonid meteors to be made offresh material knocked loose from the comet, making them betterindicators of the comet's composition than fragments that haveaged.In 1966 the Leonids put on a spectacular show, with tens ofthousands of meteors blazing through the sky each hour. Manyastronomers believe there is a good chance that this year's displaywill be just as spectacular, at least for viewers in East Asia,which will be in nighttime darkness during the few hours when theswarm is at its peak.Other experts, including Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., guess that the stormwill be much more modest, producing only 200 to 5,000 meteors perhour.In any case, meteor experts from several countries haveconverged on Asia to measure and study the Leonids as they hit theatmosphere at speeds of about 45 miles per second.Among them are teams of specialists who will fly aboard twoairplanes _ a prop-jet Electra owned by the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and an Air Force KC-135jet.Both are modified with upward-looking windows permittingphotography, spectroscopy, laser probes and other types ofobservation.For about eight hours starting before midnight in East Asia, thetwo airplanes, temporarily based in Okinawa, will fly in formationwith each other. The NCAR Electra, the slower of the two, will flyback and forth along a straight track at about 25,000 feet, whilethe Air Force KC-135, flying at about 40,000 feet, will fly anelliptical course around the Electra's path.Instruments aboard both planes, a known distance apart, willmeasure the angles between their respective views of a given meteortrail, and triangulation will allow them to calculate the altitudeof the trail.The scientists are not worried about being hit by meteors, mostof which burn up in the mesosphere far above them, 50 to 65 mileshigh. Most of the fragments are smaller than grains of sand, andonly very rarely is a meteor large enough and dense enough tosurvive its white-hot trip through the air all the way to theground.The lead experiment on the Electra, conducted by Dr. Chester S.Gardner and his team from the University of Illinois, will seek tomeasure the amount of iron dumped into the atmosphere by meteors,and to measure the temperatures of meteor trails.&QL;nnThe group has developed a new type of lidar (which stands for``light detection and ranging'') for the experiment. A lidarinstrument, similar in principle to a radar except that it useslight instead of radio waves, sends a powerful laser beam directlyupward, where it excites target atoms in the thin atmospheresensitive to the laser's wavelength.They emit light, and a telescope, aimed at exactly the spotwhere atoms excited by the laser are glowing measures and analyzesthe light.Gardner's group has built a pair of lidars based on crystals ofalexandrite, a mineral that can lase at any of a range ofwavelengths, depending on how it is ``seeded'' by a small diodelaser of the desired wavelength.Using a complex optical system, the University of Illinois grouphas tuned its lidars to two of the wavelengths of ionized iron _the form that iron assumes at very high temperatures. By sending upbeams of ultraviolet light at 372 and 374 nanometers, the groupexpects to excite iron ions to fluoresce in visible light that canbe detected and measured by the two telescopes aboard the airplane.The ratio of fluorescence triggered by the two laser beams willreveal the temperature of the high-altitude iron atoms andtherefore the meteor trail. This laser thermometer is expected toimprove understanding of the chemistry of the upper atmosphere andthe effects of meteors on it.``We can't aim the lidars in the plane. They always pointstraight up,'' Gardner said in an interview, ``so we have to waitfor a meteor trail to pass directly overhead through out beam. Onan ordinary night we have to wait five hours or more for a singletrail, but during this storm we hope the intervals between overheadmeteors will be much shorter and give us much more information.''The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is in chargeof the airborne study, which is also supported by the NationalScience Foundation and the Air Force.One of the objects of the program is to determine how a meteor'smass is related to its brightness. In another part of the program,spectrometers will analyze light from meteor trails (which oftenpersist for several seconds) in terms of their chemicalcomposition. Meteoroids are broadly classed either as silicates(especially olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) or metallicmeteorites made mostly of iron and nickel, but there are manyvariations.One of the experiments aboard the Electra is a wide-angle camerathat can record images of the glow emitted by excited sodium atomsin the atmosphere. The sodium content of the atmosphere is expectedto be significantly increased by the arrival of meteors, and sodiumat high altitude reacts with ozone.Scientists hope to learn whether meteor storms degrade the ozoneshield protecting life on earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.Meanwhile, the operators of scores of scientific, military andcommercial satellites have prepared the best they can for thesand-blasting the meteor storm may produce. Solar panels have beenturned edgewise to present small targets to meteoroids, and someelectrical systems have been shut down to minimize the chances ofdestructive short circuits triggered by impacts.A satellite regarded as particularly endangered by the Leonidsis the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) designed and built bythe Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to studycharged particles coming from the sun and beyond the solar system.Launched last year, ACE is now one million miles from the earthin the direction of the sun _ a very vulnerable position close tothe center of the comet's wake. NASA is reorienting the spacecraftto present a small target, but Dr. Mary Chiu, ACE's programmanager, said ``we're crossing our fingers in hopes of anuneventful day on the 17th.''
