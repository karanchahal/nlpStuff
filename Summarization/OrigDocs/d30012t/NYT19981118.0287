NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;Low pressure will move northeast over the northern Great LakesThursday. A conveyor belt of cold, moist air to the northwest ofthe low's track will cause moderate to heavy snow over northernMinnesota to persist into the afternoon. An additional few inchesof snow will accumulate after sunrise, bringing storm totals tonearly a foot in some places. Patchy light snow and flurries willlinger over the eastern Dakotas and the rest of Minnesota.A cold front extending south from the low will cross the Ohioand middle Mississippi valleys. Scattered showers and isolatedthunderstorms will precede the front. Given that moist air from theGulf of Mexico is limited, heavy rain is unlikely and rainfalltotals will generally remain below one half inch.Milder air surging north ahead of the front will encounterstubborn chilly air in the northern Appalachians. As the warm airis forced to rise above the cooler air near the ground, clouds andpockets of drizzle will develop over the Northeastern states, aidedby damp air penetrating inland from the Atlantic. Showers willdevelop Thursday night as the front approaches.Although a rogue shower is possible, most of the Southeast willremain dry through Thursday evening. Florida will be partly sunnyand very warm, with near record warmth in southern sections.A stream of mild, moist air from the Pacific Ocean will directan area of rain onto the Northwest coast with snow falling in theCascades. Meanwhile, high pressure over the Great Basin willsponsor sunny, tranquil conditions from the central Rockies tosouthern California.Focus: Eye ProtectionFor three hours on Tuesday, no images were received from thesatellite that normally provides constant coverage for most ofNorth America and the Atlantic. Technicians had repositioned themirror that is used to make images of the earth so that thefusillade of tiny particles from the Leonid meteor shower would beless likely to damage the eye in the sky. There are fivegeostationary satellites spaced approximately 70 degrees oflongitude apart that are essential tools for monitoring globalweather changes. All of these satellites came through Tuesday'smeteor shower unscathed.
