The much-anticipated storm of Leonid meteors swept over Earth onTuesday, a bit ahead of schedule, leaving many sky watchersdisappointed but others dazzled by fireballs as bright as the fullmoon.The Leonids, so named because they appear to come from theconstellation Leo, flash through the sky in large numbers everyyear about this date, but once in about every 33 years the swarm isoften so dense that tens or hundreds of meteors are seen each hour.The last such storm was in 1966, and a good show was expectedthis year. Another good Leonid display might occur a year from now,astronomers have forecast.The Leonid meteors, most of them smaller than grains of sand,are fragments knocked loose from Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle each timeit makes a close approach to the Sun every 33 years.Reports from regions that were in nighttime darkness Tuesdayduring the peak of the meteor storm suggested wide variations inthe storm's apparent intensity. But nowhere did the reported rateof meteor sightings greatly exceed 2,000 per hour _ barelyone-tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during thegreat 1966 Leonid storm.There were no immediate reports of damage to any of the roughly600 satellites orbiting the Earth that are used for communications,military surveillance, climate and weather monitoring, astronomyand navigation. The odds of any given satellite being hit by ameteoroid were calculated as about one in a thousand _ a small riskbut one that caused some concern because of the high value of manysatellites. Satellite experts said that some damage might take daysto detect, but that satellites generally seemed to have escapeddisabling harm.Forecasts that the Leonids would put on their best show overJapan and China were only partly realized; according to news agencyreports, people in parts of Thailand saw many bright meteor trails,while the view from Tokyo was disappointing.The meteor display was unexpectedly good over southern Europe,and came several hours earlier than predicted.The Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge,Mass., which is a worldwide clearinghouse for reports fromastronomers, said that observers at La Palma in the Canary Islandssaw about 2,000 meteors per hour at the peak. But observers inPortugal counted only a few more than 300 per hour.Dr. Brian Marsden of the astrophysical observatory said theLeonid display included an unusually high proportion of fireballs,a few of which reached the brightness of the full moon during theirspeedy crossing of the sky.Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a meteorite weighingseveral ounces was seen to land during the Leonid storm in front ofa car in the city of Rustavi in Georgia.But Marsden expressed doubt that the meteorite was part of thestorm. ``We sometimes see sporadic meteorites during these stormsthat are not related to the main body of meteoroids,'' he said.``This sounds like one.''Only very rarely is a meteoroid large enough and dense enough tosurvive its fiery trip through the atmosphere and reach the ground.Old records suggest, however, that as many as half a dozen people(and one dog) may have been killed by meteors during the course ofhuman history. But there is ample geological evidence that hugemeteoroids have hit the Earth in the distant past, and probablywill again.
