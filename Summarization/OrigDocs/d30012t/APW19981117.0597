DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought highground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacularcelestial fireworks in 33 years, after enjoying a low-key previewMonday night.The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in itsentire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and intoearly Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display offalling stars too numerous to wish upon.Sky-watchers will get a final chance at the big show Wednesdaynight, after which sporadic showers may be visible for severaldays.The front-row seats were expected to be wherever the sky wasdarkest and clearest _ from the Mongolian steppes to the mountainsof northern Thailand to U.S. research planes breaking through cloudcover over Okinawa, Japan.For millions of others _ those befogged by weather or living inNorth America, when the spectacle was to reach its peak at midday,the worst time for viewing _ the Internet was the place to be.In northern Thailand, hotels, camp grounds and airlines werebooked solid with people expected to head to Doi Inthanon, theSoutheast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464feet).For those who went up Monday night, the streaking star-fall cameinto view at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (1830 GMT Monday) to a chorusof ``oohs'' and ``aahs,'' and 33-year-old Thamarong Kudpong madehis wish: ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would like a son.''Many in Japan were wishing Tuesday for the weather to clear. Thegovernment called on public offices and private businesses in thecities to turn off their lights to enhance viewing possibilities.In Thailand, police anticipated a rush out of Bangkok, thesmog-ceilinged capital, by people looking for a clearer view.Alternative traffic routes were posted to avoid worsening eveningrush hour.Officials in the capital ordered all public parks closed Tuesdaynight for fear that hordes of stargazers would not be safe in thedark, said a local television station.At least one member of the Thai royal family, PrincessSirindhorn, was traveling to a rural eastern province to observethe show, ITV also reported.The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the CometTempel-Tuttle. The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancientobservers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and shedsswarms of particles as it nears the sun. In 1966, the Leonidsdisplay peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces itsown orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowingcontrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.Many of the world's 600-plus satellites have been maneuvered toreduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which canpoke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatingsor cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir spacestations was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter theSoyuz escape capsule when the shower is at its peak.``It is better to be on the safe side,'' Deputy Mission Controlchief Viktor Blagov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass newsagency.In Romania, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said in afront-page headline: ``Romanians, Stay Inside! Leonide, theToughest Meteor Rain.''
