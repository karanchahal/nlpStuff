Whether they stood on the tallest mountain in Thailand or thedesert in California, tens of thousands of people were searchingthe skies for a glimpse of the biggest meteor shower in decades.Clouds interfered with the view from many sites, but manystargazers were rewarded with a spectacular view of meteorsstreaking through the skies in blazes of red and white as theLeonid meteor shower reached its climax early Wednesday in Asia.The shower, which peaks every 33 years, is caused by the Earth'spassage through the long tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Thestorm, which began Monday, got its name because it appears to comefrom the direction of the constellation Leo.The biggest crowds gathered in Asia, which was best positionedfor viewing the climax, but the spectacle was seen throughout theglobe _ weather permitting.In Tokyo and many other Asian cities, public offices and privatebusinesses turned off their lights to enhance viewing. Though thenight remained bright in the Tokyo area, meteors could be seenstreaking across the skies every two or three minutes at the peakof the storm.``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, ahousewife watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo suburbof Yokohama.Tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to Doi Inthanon,Thailand's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet), and DoiSuthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.People shrieked and squealed with delight as they glimpsed thenight's first shooting star at almost exactly 1 a.m. Wednesday(1800 GMT Tuesday). But their enjoyment was tempered by the sightof clouds moving in.Officials said 10,000 people had passed through the nationalpark's gates by 7:30 p.m. Tuesday (1230 GMT), seven hours beforethe anticipated peak of the promised celestial spectacle.People huddled in blankets drove in, paid the 20 baht (55 U.S.cents) entrance fee and continued up the mountain, scouting forsuitable viewing spots and turning the park into a tent city. Themountain's actual peak was reserved for dignitaries and scientists.The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert inCalifornia were smaller but no less enthusiastic.The desert's campgrounds, normally empty on November weeknights,were jammed with dozens of stargazers in the early morning hours,many peering through telescopes and whooping and hollering witheach dazzling display from the Leonid meteor shower.Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors as shewatched the skies from Mercy Hot Springs, about 30 miles (50kilometers) south of Los Banos.``I could see in front of me big streaks of light falling on thehighway,'' she said.Most Australians who rose early Wednesday were disappointed tofind storm clouds blocking the rare display of celestial fireworks.Sydney Observatory astronomy curator Nick Lomb said that whilesome astronomers at Parkes Observatory, in northwestern New SouthWales, had seen fireballs through the clouds, it was not the meteorstorm they had hoped for.The view apparently was clearer in Norway, where rescuers wereswamped with calls from people who spotted what they thought werered distress flares fired from ships in trouble off the southerncoast.``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they werebright red, so I can understand that people associated them withdistress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
