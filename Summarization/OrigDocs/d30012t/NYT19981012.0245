 
   Periodically for at least the last 1,000 years, a spectacular
rain of meteors spawned by a passing comet has lighted up the sky,
inspiring fear, wonder and admiration.
 
 
   The meteor storm, which shot hundreds of thousands of blazing
streaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is soon due to hit the
Earth again, and this time space scientists are concerned about its
effects.
 
 
   The behavior of periodic meteor storms is hard to predict with
certainty. The meteor show forecast for Nov. 17 or 18 might be
spectacular or it might be a dud.
 
 
   But whichever the case, every one of the 600-odd satellites
orbiting the Earth _ spacecraft used for communications, military
reconnaissance, peace-keeping missions, climate and weather
monitoring, astronomy, navigation and science _ will be hit by
ultra-high-speed meteor dust.
 
 
   The possibility of major damage to any of the satellites is
regarded by experts as small, but cannot be discounted. This storm
of meteors, called Leonid meteors because they come from the
direction of constellation Leo, will be the first to hit the Earth
since 1966 when the world's space programs were in their infancy,
and its effects on satellite systems are uncertain.
 
 
   But the fear of possible damage has prompted many meetings by
experts in recent months to discuss ways of minimizing hazards, and
the operators of important satellites are taking no chances.
Whenever possible, satellites will be turned out of the way of the
meteor storm for a few hours and placed in partial electronic
hibernation.
 
 
   Both military and commercial satellite operators said that even
during maneuvering, major satellite functions would continue,
including the transmission of voice, data and television traffic.
 
 
   The only human beings who will be in space during the storm are
the Russian crew of the Mir space laboratory, which will be unable
to get out of the way. American space officials said they expected
the Russians to ride out the storm inside the Soyuz reentry
vehicle, docked with Mir, enabling them to make a quick escape if
Mir should be badly damaged.
 
 
   In a normal day, dozens of meteors hit the Earth's atmosphere
and burn up. But besides this steady influx of meteors, there are
also occasional showers and meteor storms associated with passing
comets.
 
 
   The Leonid meteors begin as dust or small chunks that break
loose from Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle whenever it approaches the Sun.
Once every 33 years, the ribbon-like stream of dust and particles
trailing the comet usually intersects the Earth's orbit around the
Sun, just as the Earth is passing.
 
 
   Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle, about two and a half miles in diameter,
was discovered in 1865 by Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who
calculated that its orbit around the Sun took a little over 33
years. The historical record of the Leonid meteor storms goes back
at least 1,000 years.
 
 
   The comet itself has never come close to hitting the Earth. But
particles that break loose from the comet are another matter.
 
 
   In a report to Congress in May, Dr. William H. Ailor of the
Aerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., a consultant to the Air
Force on hazards to spacecraft, warned that this year's Leonid
storm would pose the most serious meteoroid threat ever faced by
the world's spacecraft.
 
 
   He said, ``Because of the very high speed of the particles _
they will be moving at speeds over 155,000 miles an hour _ the
storm poses an even greater and somewhat unknown threat.''
 
 
   (Astronomers designate objects moving earthward as
``meteoroids.'' When one of these hits the atmosphere and burns up
it is called a ``meteor.'' If a meteor survives through the
atmosphere and hits the ground it is called a ``meteorite.'')
 
 
   Showers of Leonid meteors may produce hundreds or thousands of
blazing meteors each hour. Such storms pose no danger to life on
the ground because most of the cometary particles are smaller than
grains of sand and burn up high in the atmosphere. Occasionally,
larger chunks enter the atmosphere to produce bolides _ fireballs _
that leave luminous trails sometimes persisting for several
minutes. Sometimes bolides explode, producing dazzling flashes of
light.
 
 
   Dr. Ahmet Ozkul of Intelsat, the largest operator of global
communications satellites, estimates that the probability of any of
the company's 20 satellites being damaged by a Leonid meteoroid in
November will be less than 2 percent if no precautionary measures
are taken.
 
 
   But operators intend to do what they can. One precaution will be
to maneuver these two-ton satellites (each valued at about $1.5
million) so as to present smaller targets for meteoroids.
 
 
   ``During the Leonid shower,'' he said, ``most operators will
slue their satellites around so that their big solar panels are
turned edgewise to the stream of particles.''
 
 
   Ground controllers of some satellites plan to reduce the volume
of commands from ground stations to avoid electronic garbling and
erroneous commands that can be caused by the impact of dust
particles.
 
 
   Meteoroid damage to spacecraft has been rare since the mid-1960s
when spacecraft became common. An exception was a European
communications satellite named Olympus, which was knocked out of
operation in 1993, presumably by meteoroid impact.
 
 
   (Another recent failure of a communications satellite occurred
on May 19, when uncontrolled spinning of Galaxy IV shut down most
pagers in the United States for nearly a day. A spokesman for the
Panamsat Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., the owner of the satellite,
said it had been determined that its loss had resulted from
internal failure, not from a hit by a meteoroid or debris.)
 
 
   In 1993, astronauts conducting a repair mission on the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope found a hole about the size of a quarter in
one of the instrument's dish antennas. The hole might have been
made by a meteoroid, although Dr. John Campbell of the Space
Telescope Science Institute, which operates the satellite, said the
damage was more likely to have been from the impact of a piece of
man-made debris from some space mission.
 
 
   Space experts consider ``sand blasting'' by micrometeoroid to be
a more likely threat than penetrating hits. Without actually
piercing vital parts of spacecraft, the hail of microscopic
particles is expected to cause wear and tear during the few hours
of the storm, that would be equivalent to the wear and tear of up
to three years of normal operation without meteoroid storms.
 
 
   nn
 
 
   Another hazard is electrical.
 
 
   A microscopic particle hitting the skin of a spacecraft at 44
miles per second is vaporized into plasma _ an ultra-hot,
electrically charged gas. During the plasma's ephemeral existence
it may conduct its electrostatic charge to the spacecraft, causing
arcing, short circuits and damage to computer chips and circuits.
 
 
   Sand blasting by comet dust can also damage mirrors, lenses and
the optical components used by spy satellites, weather sensors and
orbiting astronomical instruments, including the Hubble Space
Telescope.
 
 
   ``Before, during and after the Leonid storm,'' Campbell said,
``we intend to slue the Hubble telescope around so that its metal
back faces the meteoroids, shielding its optics from damage.''
 
 
   For 10 hours the telescope will be pointed opposite the
direction from which the meteors will be coming, he said.
 
 
   Intelsat will also slue its communications satellites, so that
their big solar panels are turned edgewise to the meteoroid stream
for about three hours, thereby presenting the smallest possible
targets, Ozkul said.
 
 
   The Intelsat satellites, which carry digital, voice and
television signals, operate 22,300 miles high in what are known as
geosynchronous orbits, in which each satellite remains permanently
over the same spot on the Earth's surface.
 
 
   Chances of serious damage to Mir are regarded as very small,
American experts said, noting that even the space shuttle has been
knicked by debris from time to time with no serious effects. (For
example, the shuttle Atlantis was hit both by a meteoroid fragment
and a piece of debris in September last year.)
 
 
   In any case, the big Mir station will not be able to maneuver
out of the way.
 
 
   To be on the safe side, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has delayed the launching of the space shuttle until
after the Leonid shower.
 
 
   Some satellites in low-earth orbits can actually hide from
meteoroid storms, Ozkul said. Some carry enough fuel that they can
maneuver into orbits in which the Earth will shield them for a
short time from the peak of the meteoroid storm.
 
 
   ``Hiding from the storm would be a judgment call,'' he said,
``because you would use up a lot of precious maneuvering fuel, but
it can be done in an emergency,'' Ozkul said. ``We couldn't do it
with our geosynchronous satellites, which are 22,300 miles up, but
some near-earth satellites could hide behind the Earth long enough
to reduce the risk.''
 
 
   The Aerospace Corp. regards the Leonid shower as a test, from
which the world's satellite owners and users will gain useful
knowledge.
 
 
   Some satellites, including the galaxy of Air Force satellites
serving the Global Positioning System of navigation, can detect and
report meteoroid hits on themselves. Such information may lead to
improved meteoroid protection for future space stations, Ailor
said.
 
 
   Of the roughly 600 active satellites in orbit, half are
American, and about half of these are military. Only ``a handful''
of these satellites will be reoriented, said Maj. Perry L. Nouis of
the Air Force, spokesman for the United States Space Command. Power
will be temporarily reduced for some satellite systems to lessen
the chance of electrical problems caused by meteoric dust, he said.
 
 
   On the positive side, Nouis said, ``This year's Leonid storm
will give us a lot of data that may be useful for protecting
satellites against future showers.''
