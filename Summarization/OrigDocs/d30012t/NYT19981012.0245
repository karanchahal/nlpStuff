Periodically for at least the last 1,000 years, a spectacularrain of meteors spawned by a passing comet has lighted up the sky,inspiring fear, wonder and admiration.The meteor storm, which shot hundreds of thousands of blazingstreaks across the heavens 33 years ago, is soon due to hit theEarth again, and this time space scientists are concerned about itseffects.The behavior of periodic meteor storms is hard to predict withcertainty. The meteor show forecast for Nov. 17 or 18 might bespectacular or it might be a dud.But whichever the case, every one of the 600-odd satellitesorbiting the Earth _ spacecraft used for communications, militaryreconnaissance, peace-keeping missions, climate and weathermonitoring, astronomy, navigation and science _ will be hit byultra-high-speed meteor dust.The possibility of major damage to any of the satellites isregarded by experts as small, but cannot be discounted. This stormof meteors, called Leonid meteors because they come from thedirection of constellation Leo, will be the first to hit the Earthsince 1966 when the world's space programs were in their infancy,and its effects on satellite systems are uncertain.But the fear of possible damage has prompted many meetings byexperts in recent months to discuss ways of minimizing hazards, andthe operators of important satellites are taking no chances.Whenever possible, satellites will be turned out of the way of themeteor storm for a few hours and placed in partial electronichibernation.Both military and commercial satellite operators said that evenduring maneuvering, major satellite functions would continue,including the transmission of voice, data and television traffic.The only human beings who will be in space during the storm arethe Russian crew of the Mir space laboratory, which will be unableto get out of the way. American space officials said they expectedthe Russians to ride out the storm inside the Soyuz reentryvehicle, docked with Mir, enabling them to make a quick escape ifMir should be badly damaged.In a normal day, dozens of meteors hit the Earth's atmosphereand burn up. But besides this steady influx of meteors, there arealso occasional showers and meteor storms associated with passingcomets.The Leonid meteors begin as dust or small chunks that breakloose from Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle whenever it approaches the Sun.Once every 33 years, the ribbon-like stream of dust and particlestrailing the comet usually intersects the Earth's orbit around theSun, just as the Earth is passing.Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle, about two and a half miles in diameter,was discovered in 1865 by Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, whocalculated that its orbit around the Sun took a little over 33years. The historical record of the Leonid meteor storms goes backat least 1,000 years.The comet itself has never come close to hitting the Earth. Butparticles that break loose from the comet are another matter.In a report to Congress in May, Dr. William H. Ailor of theAerospace Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., a consultant to the AirForce on hazards to spacecraft, warned that this year's Leonidstorm would pose the most serious meteoroid threat ever faced bythe world's spacecraft.He said, ``Because of the very high speed of the particles _they will be moving at speeds over 155,000 miles an hour _ thestorm poses an even greater and somewhat unknown threat.''(Astronomers designate objects moving earthward as``meteoroids.'' When one of these hits the atmosphere and burns upit is called a ``meteor.'' If a meteor survives through theatmosphere and hits the ground it is called a ``meteorite.'')Showers of Leonid meteors may produce hundreds or thousands ofblazing meteors each hour. Such storms pose no danger to life onthe ground because most of the cometary particles are smaller thangrains of sand and burn up high in the atmosphere. Occasionally,larger chunks enter the atmosphere to produce bolides _ fireballs _that leave luminous trails sometimes persisting for severalminutes. Sometimes bolides explode, producing dazzling flashes oflight.Dr. Ahmet Ozkul of Intelsat, the largest operator of globalcommunications satellites, estimates that the probability of any ofthe company's 20 satellites being damaged by a Leonid meteoroid inNovember will be less than 2 percent if no precautionary measuresare taken.But operators intend to do what they can. One precaution will beto maneuver these two-ton satellites (each valued at about $1.5million) so as to present smaller targets for meteoroids.``During the Leonid shower,'' he said, ``most operators willslue their satellites around so that their big solar panels areturned edgewise to the stream of particles.''Ground controllers of some satellites plan to reduce the volumeof commands from ground stations to avoid electronic garbling anderroneous commands that can be caused by the impact of dustparticles.Meteoroid damage to spacecraft has been rare since the mid-1960swhen spacecraft became common. An exception was a Europeancommunications satellite named Olympus, which was knocked out ofoperation in 1993, presumably by meteoroid impact.(Another recent failure of a communications satellite occurredon May 19, when uncontrolled spinning of Galaxy IV shut down mostpagers in the United States for nearly a day. A spokesman for thePanamsat Corp. of Greenwich, Conn., the owner of the satellite,said it had been determined that its loss had resulted frominternal failure, not from a hit by a meteoroid or debris.)In 1993, astronauts conducting a repair mission on the orbitingHubble Space Telescope found a hole about the size of a quarter inone of the instrument's dish antennas. The hole might have beenmade by a meteoroid, although Dr. John Campbell of the SpaceTelescope Science Institute, which operates the satellite, said thedamage was more likely to have been from the impact of a piece ofman-made debris from some space mission.Space experts consider ``sand blasting'' by micrometeoroid to bea more likely threat than penetrating hits. Without actuallypiercing vital parts of spacecraft, the hail of microscopicparticles is expected to cause wear and tear during the few hoursof the storm, that would be equivalent to the wear and tear of upto three years of normal operation without meteoroid storms.nnAnother hazard is electrical.A microscopic particle hitting the skin of a spacecraft at 44miles per second is vaporized into plasma _ an ultra-hot,electrically charged gas. During the plasma's ephemeral existenceit may conduct its electrostatic charge to the spacecraft, causingarcing, short circuits and damage to computer chips and circuits.Sand blasting by comet dust can also damage mirrors, lenses andthe optical components used by spy satellites, weather sensors andorbiting astronomical instruments, including the Hubble SpaceTelescope.``Before, during and after the Leonid storm,'' Campbell said,``we intend to slue the Hubble telescope around so that its metalback faces the meteoroids, shielding its optics from damage.''For 10 hours the telescope will be pointed opposite thedirection from which the meteors will be coming, he said.Intelsat will also slue its communications satellites, so thattheir big solar panels are turned edgewise to the meteoroid streamfor about three hours, thereby presenting the smallest possibletargets, Ozkul said.The Intelsat satellites, which carry digital, voice andtelevision signals, operate 22,300 miles high in what are known asgeosynchronous orbits, in which each satellite remains permanentlyover the same spot on the Earth's surface.Chances of serious damage to Mir are regarded as very small,American experts said, noting that even the space shuttle has beenknicked by debris from time to time with no serious effects. (Forexample, the shuttle Atlantis was hit both by a meteoroid fragmentand a piece of debris in September last year.)In any case, the big Mir station will not be able to maneuverout of the way.To be on the safe side, the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration has delayed the launching of the space shuttle untilafter the Leonid shower.Some satellites in low-earth orbits can actually hide frommeteoroid storms, Ozkul said. Some carry enough fuel that they canmaneuver into orbits in which the Earth will shield them for ashort time from the peak of the meteoroid storm.``Hiding from the storm would be a judgment call,'' he said,``because you would use up a lot of precious maneuvering fuel, butit can be done in an emergency,'' Ozkul said. ``We couldn't do itwith our geosynchronous satellites, which are 22,300 miles up, butsome near-earth satellites could hide behind the Earth long enoughto reduce the risk.''The Aerospace Corp. regards the Leonid shower as a test, fromwhich the world's satellite owners and users will gain usefulknowledge.Some satellites, including the galaxy of Air Force satellitesserving the Global Positioning System of navigation, can detect andreport meteoroid hits on themselves. Such information may lead toimproved meteoroid protection for future space stations, Ailorsaid.Of the roughly 600 active satellites in orbit, half areAmerican, and about half of these are military. Only ``a handful''of these satellites will be reoriented, said Maj. Perry L. Nouis ofthe Air Force, spokesman for the United States Space Command. Powerwill be temporarily reduced for some satellite systems to lessenthe chance of electrical problems caused by meteoric dust, he said.On the positive side, Nouis said, ``This year's Leonid stormwill give us a lot of data that may be useful for protectingsatellites against future showers.''
