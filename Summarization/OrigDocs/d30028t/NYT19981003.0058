ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Tension between Turkey and Syria has risen tothe point where the top Turkish military commander says the twohostile neighbors have reached ``a state of undeclared war.''``We are trying to be patient,'' said the commander, Gen.Huseyin Kivrikoglu, ``but that has a limit.''Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship withIsrael. It also makes territorial claims against Turkey and accusesTurkey of unfairly diverting water from rivers that flow throughboth countries.For its part, Turkey is complaining ever more loudly aboutSyria's support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. The insurgentsare said to have bases in Syria, and their leader reportedly livesin Damascus.Turkey and Syria are moving troops and equipment to borderpositions, according to news reports, but no outbreak of fightingis considered imminent.``Intervention is out of the question,'' said Turkish DefenseMinister Ismet Sezgin. But he said, ``If they continue to do somuch harm, then naturally diplomacy will finish.''Turkish generals began issuing public warnings to Syria lastmonth. About the same time, during a visit to Israel, PrimeMinister Mesut Yilmaz dismissed Syrian contentions that Turkey andIsrael have sealed a ``satanic alliance.''``I don't care about Syria's reaction,'' Yilmaz said. ``Syria'shostile attitude is obvious.''Asked if military ties between Turkey and Israel are based onshared hostility toward Syria, the prime minister replied, ``If weare going to talk about hostility, then we need to look veryclosely at Syria's support for separatist terror in Turkey.''Turkey's military-dominated National Security Council discussedproblems with Syria on Wednesday, and announced afterward thatTurkey was considering imposing ``economic, political and militarysanctions'' against Syria. The next day Turkish President SuleymanDemirel asserted that Syria ``openly pursues a policy of hostilityagainst Turkey.''Syria has denied supporting Kurdish rebels. Last week theofficial Syrian newspaper Al Baath said Turkey's newly assertiveposition ``is a result of full coordination between Ankara and TelAviv in accordance with their alliance.''Turkish military commanders are frustrated by their inability tocrush Kurdish guerrillas, and have for years been sending unitsinto northern Iraq to attack their bases. They have never senttroops into Syria, a step that would be explosive.``This could be a sign of military frustration with the civiliangovernment,'' said a Middle Eastern diplomat posted in Turkey.``For a while the military was saying they had won the war and thatit was time for the civilians to step in and take over. Apparentlythey weren't too happy with what the civilians did or didn't do, sonow they're taking a new tack. They want to raise the issue inpreparation for something. What it will be, they're keepingvague.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)In another step in its new diplomatic offensive against Kurdishnationalism, Turkey has moved to improve its relations with Iraq.The decision came after a deal brokered by the United States tobring two Iraqi Kurdish leaders together last month.U.S. officials insisted that the deal was not intended to pavethe way for a Kurdish state within a future Iraqi federation. ButTurkish leaders were not convinced. They oppose federations orother arrangements in which Kurds rule themselves.Turkey has recently suffered a series of setbacks in itsdiplomatic campaign to isolate Kurdish nationalists.In August, local authorities in Lausanne, Switzerland, refusedTurkey's request to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the signingof the Lausanne Treaty, which created modern Turkey, in the hallwhere the treaty was signed. Kurdish groups had campaigned againstthe ceremony.Soon afterward, a call from the guerrillas for a cease-fire wonpraise in several European capitals, despite Turkey's refusal toconsider it. And last week a group called the Kurdish Parliament inExile has been meeting in Rome with the support of politicians fromItaly and elsewhere.``Italy made a mistake,'' said Korkmaz Haktanir, a seniorforeign ministry official. ``How can a NATO member state host aterrorist organization that threatens the unity and territorialintegrity of another NATO member state?''
