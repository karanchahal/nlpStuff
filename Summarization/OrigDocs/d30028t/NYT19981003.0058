 
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Tension between Turkey and Syria has risen to
the point where the top Turkish military commander says the two
hostile neighbors have reached ``a state of undeclared war.''
 
 
   ``We are trying to be patient,'' said the commander, Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu, ``but that has a limit.''
 
 
   Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship with
Israel. It also makes territorial claims against Turkey and accuses
Turkey of unfairly diverting water from rivers that flow through
both countries.
 
 
   For its part, Turkey is complaining ever more loudly about
Syria's support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. The insurgents
are said to have bases in Syria, and their leader reportedly lives
in Damascus.
 
 
   Turkey and Syria are moving troops and equipment to border
positions, according to news reports, but no outbreak of fighting
is considered imminent.
 
 
   ``Intervention is out of the question,'' said Turkish Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin. But he said, ``If they continue to do so
much harm, then naturally diplomacy will finish.''
 
 
   Turkish generals began issuing public warnings to Syria last
month. About the same time, during a visit to Israel, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz dismissed Syrian contentions that Turkey and
Israel have sealed a ``satanic alliance.''
 
 
   ``I don't care about Syria's reaction,'' Yilmaz said. ``Syria's
hostile attitude is obvious.''
 
 
   Asked if military ties between Turkey and Israel are based on
shared hostility toward Syria, the prime minister replied, ``If we
are going to talk about hostility, then we need to look very
closely at Syria's support for separatist terror in Turkey.''
 
 
   Turkey's military-dominated National Security Council discussed
problems with Syria on Wednesday, and announced afterward that
Turkey was considering imposing ``economic, political and military
sanctions'' against Syria. The next day Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel asserted that Syria ``openly pursues a policy of hostility
against Turkey.''
 
 
   Syria has denied supporting Kurdish rebels. Last week the
official Syrian newspaper Al Baath said Turkey's newly assertive
position ``is a result of full coordination between Ankara and Tel
Aviv in accordance with their alliance.''
 
 
   Turkish military commanders are frustrated by their inability to
crush Kurdish guerrillas, and have for years been sending units
into northern Iraq to attack their bases. They have never sent
troops into Syria, a step that would be explosive.
 
 
   ``This could be a sign of military frustration with the civilian
government,'' said a Middle Eastern diplomat posted in Turkey.
``For a while the military was saying they had won the war and that
it was time for the civilians to step in and take over. Apparently
they weren't too happy with what the civilians did or didn't do, so
now they're taking a new tack. They want to raise the issue in
preparation for something. What it will be, they're keeping
vague.''
 
 
   In another step in its new diplomatic offensive against Kurdish
nationalism, Turkey has moved to improve its relations with Iraq.
The decision came after a deal brokered by the United States to
bring two Iraqi Kurdish leaders together last month.
 
 
   U.S. officials insisted that the deal was not intended to pave
the way for a Kurdish state within a future Iraqi federation. But
Turkish leaders were not convinced. They oppose federations or
other arrangements in which Kurds rule themselves.
 
 
   Turkey has recently suffered a series of setbacks in its
diplomatic campaign to isolate Kurdish nationalists.
 
 
   In August, local authorities in Lausanne, Switzerland, refused
Turkey's request to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the signing
of the Lausanne Treaty, which created modern Turkey, in the hall
where the treaty was signed. Kurdish groups had campaigned against
the ceremony.
 
 
   Soon afterward, a call from the guerrillas for a cease-fire won
praise in several European capitals, despite Turkey's refusal to
consider it. And last week a group called the Kurdish Parliament in
Exile has been meeting in Rome with the support of politicians from
Italy and elsewhere.
 
 
   ``Italy made a mistake,'' said Korkmaz Haktanir, a senior
foreign ministry official. ``How can a NATO member state host a
terrorist organization that threatens the unity and territorial
integrity of another NATO member state?''
