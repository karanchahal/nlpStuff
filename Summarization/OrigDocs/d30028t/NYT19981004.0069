CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sign of Arab concern over growing tensionsbetween Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew onshort notice to Syria on Sunday in an effort to defuse what isbeing portrayed in the Middle East as an unsettling crisis.Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and wasexpected to renew his mediation bid on Monday by traveling toAnkara, the Turkish capital, for meetings with top officials there.Turkish officials have accused Syria of allowing the country tobe used as a base for Kurdish rebels who have been fighting forself-rule in southeastern Turkey. Official newspapers in Syria havedenied the contention and have called for talks to end the dispute,as did the Syrian and Egyptian foreign ministers after theirmeeting Sunday.The differences between the two countries include a territorialdispute and arguments over Turkey's diversion of water from the tworivers that flow into Syria.A military conflict between Syria and Turkey is still consideredremote, Egyptian officials said Sunday night. But a Turkish warningthat differences with Syria had reached the stage of ``undeclaredwar'' has prompted worries that if clashes began, they mightspread.``This is a fire that has been smoldering for a long time, butit has now reached the point at which it wouldn't take a whole lotmore to turn it into a real blaze,'' a diplomat from Cairo said.In this region, at least, the situation is considered explosivebecause of Turkey's new and friendlier relations with Israel. Thetwo countries signed a military cooperation agreement in 1996 andhave conducted several joint exercises.A number of Arab newspapers have suggested that Turkey'salignment with Israel may lie behind its toughened stance towardSyria.A typical editorial, published Sunday in the independental-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said that it was``notable that the sudden Turkish escalation has come in theframework of the military alliance with Tel Aviv, whereby Syria isplaced between the hammer and anvil.''Israel, for its part, has taken pains to distance itself fromthe crisis, saying it plans to scale down its military activityalong its border with Syria to signal that it is not a party to thedispute.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The Arab League, which last month formally condemned theTurkish-Israeli ties, issued a statement Sunday saying that thetensions between Turkey and Syria represented ``a blatant threat tothe security and stability of the region.'' But only Iraq amongArab countries has explicitly criticized Turkey for the hard linethat it has taken against Syria.Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its willingness to accepta diplomatic solution, its official statements have also maintaineda vaguely threatening air.``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world,'' theAnatolia news agency quoted President Suleyman Demirel as sayingSunday. ``This cannot continue. We are in a position ofself-defense. The situation is serious. Turkey has suffered formany years, and it no longer wants to suffer.''
