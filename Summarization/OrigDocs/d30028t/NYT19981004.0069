 
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sign of Arab concern over growing tensions
between Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew on
short notice to Syria on Sunday in an effort to defuse what is
being portrayed in the Middle East as an unsettling crisis.
 
 
   Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and was
expected to renew his mediation bid on Monday by traveling to
Ankara, the Turkish capital, for meetings with top officials there.
 
 
   Turkish officials have accused Syria of allowing the country to
be used as a base for Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey. Official newspapers in Syria have
denied the contention and have called for talks to end the dispute,
as did the Syrian and Egyptian foreign ministers after their
meeting Sunday.
 
 
   The differences between the two countries include a territorial
dispute and arguments over Turkey's diversion of water from the two
rivers that flow into Syria.
 
 
   A military conflict between Syria and Turkey is still considered
remote, Egyptian officials said Sunday night. But a Turkish warning
that differences with Syria had reached the stage of ``undeclared
war'' has prompted worries that if clashes began, they might
spread.
 
 
   ``This is a fire that has been smoldering for a long time, but
it has now reached the point at which it wouldn't take a whole lot
more to turn it into a real blaze,'' a diplomat from Cairo said.
 
 
   In this region, at least, the situation is considered explosive
because of Turkey's new and friendlier relations with Israel. The
two countries signed a military cooperation agreement in 1996 and
have conducted several joint exercises.
 
 
   A number of Arab newspapers have suggested that Turkey's
alignment with Israel may lie behind its toughened stance toward
Syria.
 
 
   A typical editorial, published Sunday in the independent
al-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said that it was
``notable that the sudden Turkish escalation has come in the
framework of the military alliance with Tel Aviv, whereby Syria is
placed between the hammer and anvil.''
 
 
   Israel, for its part, has taken pains to distance itself from
the crisis, saying it plans to scale down its military activity
along its border with Syria to signal that it is not a party to the
dispute.
 
 
   The Arab League, which last month formally condemned the
Turkish-Israeli ties, issued a statement Sunday saying that the
tensions between Turkey and Syria represented ``a blatant threat to
the security and stability of the region.'' But only Iraq among
Arab countries has explicitly criticized Turkey for the hard line
that it has taken against Syria.
 
 
   Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its willingness to accept
a diplomatic solution, its official statements have also maintained
a vaguely threatening air.
 
 
   ``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted President Suleyman Demirel as saying
Sunday. ``This cannot continue. We are in a position of
self-defense. The situation is serious. Turkey has suffered for
many years, and it no longer wants to suffer.''
