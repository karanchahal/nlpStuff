	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Damascus on Sunday to try to defuse growing tension between Syria
and Turkey.
	   Mubarak was met at the airport by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
and the two leaders drove straight to Assad's palace for talks.
	   The talks come as Turkey has massed forces near the border with
Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the
neighboring country.
	   In a show of force on Friday, Turkish jets buzzed the Syrian
frontier, a Turkish daily reported.
	   Mubarak had made an unannounced trip to Riyadh on Saturday to
get backing from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for his mediation
efforts. Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million
people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
	   ``We have to stop the tension and contain it, and military
threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus
and Ankara.''
	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in
Ankara, possibly on Monday.
	   Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied Mubarak to Saudi
Arabia and Syria, said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday
with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser
Yakis.
	   Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish
population in southeastern Turkey.
	   Late last week, Turkey sent 10,000 troops into northern Iraq to
hit bases that Turkish Kurds use for their uprising.
	   Damascus denies sheltering Kurdish fighters. A government
statement Saturday confirmed Syria's ``keenness for good,
neighborly relations with Turkey'' as well as readiness to resolve
disputes ``in diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military
alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
	   Damascus also accuses Turkey of building a series of dams on the
Euphrates River that threaten to reduce Syria's water supply.
