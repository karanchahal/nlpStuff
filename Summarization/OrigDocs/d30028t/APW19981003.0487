	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived Saturday for a one-day visit to discuss regional problems
with Saudi King Fahd and other high-ranking officials.
	   The talks will focus on the Middle East peace process and the
recent military tensions between Turkey and Syria over Turkish
allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels,
diplomats said.
	   The two leaders also will discuss the U.N. air embargo on Libya,
said the diplomats on condition of anonymity. The embargo is aimed
at forcing Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the
1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   This is the first time that Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, is
meeting with a foreign leader since undergoing surgery Aug. 12 to
have his gallbladder removed.
	   Fahd's half-brother, Crown Prince Abdullah, handled the
kingdom's day-to-day affairs during the king's hospitalization.
