	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
will go to Syria and Turkey to help cool tensions between the two
countries, which appear to be edging toward a military conflict, a
top Egyptian official said Saturday.
	   Mubarak ``will head within the next few hours to Syria and
Turkey to hold discussions,'' Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in
Riyadh where Mubarak met with Saudi King Fahd earlier.
	   Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along
its border with Syria after stepping up its accusations in recent
days that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels and in a government statement
Saturday confirmed ``its keenness for good neighborly relations
with Turkey'' as well as its readiness to solve every issue through
``diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''
	   Earlier Saturday, Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said his
forces would soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border.
