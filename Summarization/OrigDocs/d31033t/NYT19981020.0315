WASHINGTON _ Stinging from the government's opening statement, adefiant Microsoft Corp. forcefully defended its chairman, BillGates, in federal court on Tuesday, asserting that theno-holds-barred tactics of his company are not only common in thecomputer industry but also good for economy.Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit wascrafted as much for public opinion as for the court. The companyfaces weeks of being portrayed as an alleged commercial predator ina highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft'sreputation even if it wins.The government's case, which opened on Monday in the U.S.District Court here, amounts to a litany of episodes of Microsoft'shaving used its market power to bully and bend competitors,business partners and corporate customers to its will.On Tuesday, Microsoft's legal team sought to frame theseepisodes as part of rough-and-tumble capitalism. While the wayMicrosoft does business may not be to everyone's liking, theysuggested, it is certainly not illegal.``The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business,''said John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer.In his two-hour opening statement, Warden angrily accused thegovernment of trying to ``demonize Bill Gates,'' whom he describedas ``a man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of thebenefits that society is reaping from the information age.''The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, Wardensaid, are misinterpreting routine business meetings in the computerindustry as anticompetitive conspiracies. The government's casefocuses largely on the Internet software market and the businesspractices Microsoft used in its fight against the NetscapeCommunications Corp., the early leader in the browser software usedto navigate the World Wide Web.A key charge in the suit, for example, is that Microsoft proddedNetscape to illegally divide up the browser market in a June 1995meeting _ a charge based mainly on the accounts of Netscapeexecutives.``Netscape's account of this meeting was fantastical,'' Wardensaid. ``None of the histrionics, shouting and table poundingoccurred. It's fantasy.''In Microsoft's view, the government's case is wrongheadedbecause it does not understand the computer industry, especiallythe necessity of cooperation among companies so that sophisticatedtechnology products work with each other. Just as the line betweenone software product and another often blurs, the company argues,so does the line between competition and cooperation; rivals in onearea routinely cooperate in another.Microsoft will attempt to cast doubt on several of thegovernment's allegations by characterizing meetings as efforts atcooperation by companies that, understandably, do not always agree.The government, for example, has alleged that Microsoft tried topressure both the Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to back offInternet software efforts than conflicted with Microsoft's plans _and to support Microsoft in the browser war.``Those proposals and threats claimed by the government,''Warden said, ``will be shown by evidence to have beengarden-variety commercial discussions between companies developingcomplementary products. They are of no antitrust consequence.''As the defendant, Microsoft does not have to prove that itbehaved innocently or even ethically. Instead, the role ofMicrosoft's legal team is to cast considerable doubt on thegovernment's case _ both its specific allegations of bullyingtactics and its broad theme that the economy and consumers areultimately harmed by Microsoft's behavior.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)nnIn the afternoon court session, the Microsoft defense moved tothe cross-examination of the government's lead-off witness, JamesBarksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape. To speedup the trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered that directtestimony from witnesses for both sides must be submitted inwriting beforehand. So all the courtroom questioning of witnessesbegins with cross-examination.With Barksdale on the stand, Microsoft's legal tactics soonbecame apparent. Warden, a detailed, methodical interrogator,sought to portray Netscape as a Microsoft rival that went runningto the Justice Department as a business tactic.His questions also tried to lead Barksdale into admitting thatall software makers are constantly adding new features to theirproducts and that many companies have large shares of their marketswithout being branded a monopolist _ central themes of Microsoft'sdefense.A lean, craggy 55-year-old executive who speaks with the accentof his native Louisiana, Barksdale proved an elusive and oftenentertaining witness. Warden asked Barksdale about the early yearsof his career when he worked as a salesman for the IBM Corp. from1965 to 1972, years when IBM faced the kind of antitrust scrutinyMicrosoft faces today.Warden asked Barksdale if he believed the then-dominant IBM wasa monopolist. ``I don't know if I believed it,'' Barksdale replied,``but we were trained to behave as if we were a monopoly because wewere operating under a consent decree,'' as Microsoft is today.Warden then asked Barksdale if he did not believe that thedominant product of that day _ the IBM mainframe computer _ was nota so-called bundled product of hardware and software that customershad to buy together.The question relates to the current case because the governmentalleges that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its InternetExplorer browser are in fact two products bundled together for thepurpose of forcing customers who want its industry-standardoperating system to also take its browser. Microsoft says thebrowser is a feature of its Windows operating system, and thus asingle product.To the mainframe question, Barksdale replied that IBM mainframehardware and software was sold as a bundle but that a 1968 consentdecree forced IBM to also sell them separately _ very similar tothe unbundling remedy that the government is seeking in the currentMicrosoft case.``That forced unbundling gave rise to a whole new industry ofhardware companies like Amdahl that made mainframe machines thatrun IBM mainframe software,'' Barksdale said.To try to show that Netscape viewed a government suit as acompetitive tactic, Warden repeatedly questioned Barksdale abouthis meetings with Justice Department officials including JoelKlein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrustdivision.Warden produced a document for presentation at a Netscapestrategy meeting, titled the ``Project Rocket Launch Plan.'' At themeeting, held early this year, one of four items under the heading``The Situation'' was ``DOJ and court actions create opportunityfor Netscape.''Warden then asked Barksdale whether he viewed a JusticeDepartment suit as a ``key'' opportunity for his company. Not a keyone perhaps, Barksdale replied, but he did view a governmentantitrust suit against Microsoft as ``a way of protecting anopportunity to keep the playing field open for Internet software.''
