 
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a recent move that indicated he has no
intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business
tactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposed
acquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm
Pilot hand-held computer, according to people who have been briefed
on the discussions.
 
 
   The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric
Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
 
 
   But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluring
kingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its software
business, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system, Gates would make the company's remaining Palm
Computing hardware business, ``the Compaq Computer of the hand-held
market.''
 
 
   Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word of
the meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at which
the two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilities
between the two companies, according to several people privy to the
discussions.
 
 
   Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach provides
graphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics. As in its
abortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit,
which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department,
Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets where
its own products are not competitive enough to unseat established
brands.
 
 
   And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsoft
has not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the Justice
Department's antitrust suit. The antitrust suit, initiated last
October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet
Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry-dominant Windows
95 operating system. But more recently, the Justice Department has
begun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.
 
 
   Negotiations to control development and production of the
software that powers the most popular hand-held computer, the Palm
Pilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand-held devices,
from note-taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of the
market where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gaining
ground. The market is seen as growing more quickly than the
computer industry over all.
 
 
   ``Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor,'' said
Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisher
of his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. ``I don't
think the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all.''
 
 
   While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of the
overture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lost
confidence in the Windows CE software.
 
 
   ``Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buy
the Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false,'' said
Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.
 
 
   ``3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions with
them,'' he added. ``But it would be inappropriate to comment on
those discussions.''
 
 
   A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not comment
on any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.
 
 
   Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships in
other areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in the
market for hand-held computers.
 
 
   Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoft
introduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.
Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand-held unit the Palm-sized
PC.
 
 
   The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5
million copies of its hand-held device, making it the dominant
player in the market for so-called personal digital assistants
after earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed to
gain broad acceptance.
 
 
   By comparison, only about 750,000 Windows CE-based hand-held
systems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at
Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.
