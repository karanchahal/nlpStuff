SAN FRANCISCO _ In a recent move that indicated he has nointention of backing away from his company's aggressive businesstactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposedacquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular PalmPilot hand-held computer, according to people who have been briefedon the discussions.The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, EricBenhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluringkingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its softwarebusiness, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CEoperating system, Gates would make the company's remaining PalmComputing hardware business, ``the Compaq Computer of the hand-heldmarket.''Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word ofthe meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at whichthe two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilitiesbetween the two companies, according to several people privy to thediscussions.Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach providesgraphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics. As in itsabortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit,which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department,Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets whereits own products are not competitive enough to unseat establishedbrands.And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsofthas not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the JusticeDepartment's antitrust suit. The antitrust suit, initiated lastOctober, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its InternetExplorer World Wide Web browser with the industry-dominant Windows95 operating system. But more recently, the Justice Department hasbegun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.Negotiations to control development and production of thesoftware that powers the most popular hand-held computer, the PalmPilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand-held devices,from note-taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of themarket where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gainingground. The market is seen as growing more quickly than thecomputer industry over all.``Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor,'' saidAndrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisherof his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. ``I don'tthink the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of theoverture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lostconfidence in the Windows CE software.``Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buythe Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false,'' saidGreg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.``3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions withthem,'' he added. ``But it would be inappropriate to comment onthose discussions.''A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not commenton any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships inother areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in themarket for hand-held computers.Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoftintroduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand-held unit the Palm-sizedPC.The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5million copies of its hand-held device, making it the dominantplayer in the market for so-called personal digital assistantsafter earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed togain broad acceptance.By comparison, only about 750,000 Windows CE-based hand-heldsystems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst atGiga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.
