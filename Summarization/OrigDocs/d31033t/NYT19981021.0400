 
   WASHINGTON _ Attempting to refute a central allegation in the
government's antitrust case, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday produced
a secret e-mail message from the chairman of Netscape
Communications Corp. seeking Microsoft's cooperation, offering to
stay out of its way and suggesting that Microsoft invest in
Netscape.
 
 
   The e-mail, written on Dec. 29, 1994, was introduced to suggest
that it was Netscape, not Microsoft, that initiated some of the
elements of what the government portrays as an illegal offer by
Microsoft in June 1995 to divide with Netscape the market for
software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
 
 
   The e-mail message, written by James Clark, the chairman and
cofounder of Netscape, was submitted in court Wednesday by
Microsoft as part of its defense in the sweeping antitrust suit
filed by the Justice Department and 20 states. It was perhaps the
most surprising piece of evidence produced during a second day of
often combative cross-examination of the government's leading
witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of
Netscape.
 
 
   Throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, John Warden,
Microsoft's lead lawyer, frequently tried to goad Barksdale to
concede key points in Microsoft's defense _ namely, that Netscape's
browser is widely distributed despite Microsoft's allegedly unfair
business practices, and that Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
only began gaining market share against Netscape's Navigator in the
fall of 1996, because Explorer had been significantly improved, not
because of predatory conduct on the part of Microsoft.
 
 
   Barksdale made few concessions, repeatedly replying, ``No, I
don't agree.''
 
 
   In the e-mail memo to Dan Rosen, a Microsoft executive, Clark
wrote ``We have never planned to compete with you.''
 
 
   Later, Clark wrote, ``We want to make this company a success,
but not at Microsoft's expense. We'd like to work with you. Working
together could be in your self-interest as well as ours. Depending
on the interest level, you might take an equity position in
Netscape, with the ability to expand the position later.''
 
 
   Clark concluded his e-mail appeal by noting, ``No one in my
organization knows about this message.''
 
 
   Barksdale said he did not know about the e-mail until recently
and that the first time he saw it was in court Wednesday. He said
that Clark told him about his December 1994 proposal to Microsoft
this summer when Netscape executives were being deposed by
Microsoft's legal team in preparation for the trial.
 
 
   ``He said that he made an offer to them including some of this
and that it was rejected,'' Barksdale testified.
 
 
   On the witness stand Wednesday, Barksdale sought to portray the
December 1994 e-mail from Clark as a freelance overture that did
not represent corporate policy. ``He never discussed it with the
board, and he never discussed it with me,'' Barksdale said.
 
 
   Because Clark's offer was quickly dismissed by Microsoft, the
government asserts that its introduction in court by Microsoft is
mainly an effort by the defense to try to ``change the facts and
change the subject,'' in the words of David Boies, special trial
counsel for the Justice Department.
 
 
   The December 1994 e-mail is not related, the government
contends, to the June 1995 meeting in which the Justice Department
says that Microsoft made its illegal offer. According to the
government, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape and
give Netscape's software developers crucial technical information
about the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not to
make a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoft
released two months later.
 
 
   The government says Netscape rejected Microsoft's collusion
pact, while Microsoft replies that the government is
misrepresenting what was a routine business meeting.
 
 
   Clark sent his e-mail during Netscape's precarious startup
phase, before the company had yet begun to garner a lot of sales
and with Clark watching his $5 million investment in the company
dwindle. In his testimony, Barksdale tried to dismiss the memo as a
sales ploy, perhaps made in desperation, as opposed to a genuine
business plan for Netscape.
 
 
   Warden asked Barksdale of Clark, ``Do you regard him as a
truthful man?''
 
 
   After pausing, Barksdale replied, ``I regard him as a
salesman.''
 
 
   ``I'm not going to touch that,'' Warden responded.
 
 
   Microsoft also introduced a portion of Clark's pretrial
deposition to try to prove that as early as the fall of 1994
Netscape was aware of Microsoft's intention to bundle its browser
with its Windows operating system.
 
 
   This is potentially significant because the government says that
Microsoft's principal reason for folding the browser into the
operating system was as an anticompetitive tactic to undermine
Netscape. In the fall of 1994, Microsoft asserts, Netscape had not
yet produced its first product.
 
 
   In his deposition, Clark testified that he first heard Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, talk of bundling the browser and
the operating system at an industry conference in October 1994.
 
 
   Clark was asked if he had a personal conversation with Gates
about this, and Clark said no, instead recalling it as a vaguely
threatening comment made to the conference audience.
 
 
   ``All he said was: I hope no one plans to make money on browsers
because they will be bundled into the operating system,'' Clark
said.
 
 
   In his cross-examination, Warden also tried to establish that
Netscape had long viewed all-but-free distribution of its browser
as part of its business plan. This assertion relates to the case
because Microsoft's decision to distribute its Internet Explorer
browser free is characterized in the government's suit as one of
several extraordinarily aggressive steps Microsoft took to try to
undercut Netscape.
 
 
   To make this point, Warden introduced as evidence portions of
the manuscript from a new book, ``Competing on Internet Time:
Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' by Michael
Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management, and David Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard business school.
 
 
   The book, based on extensive interviews with present and former
Netscape executives, quotes Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and
executive vice president, as describing browser marketing as ``free
but not free.''
 
 
   The concept refers to the notion that many individuals and
corporations downloaded browser software from Netscape's Web site
without paying for it. Still, free distribution is valuable because
it encourages companies to adopt Netscape's technology, and
Netscape bases its business on selling large software packages for
hub computers, or servers, that feed data to many personal
computers in a network.
 
 
   Warden raised the issue to suggest that Netscape's business
model did not vary much from what Microsoft did.
 
 
   When asked about it, Barksdale replied, ``I have never heard
this term `free but not free.' I have not heard it, I don't espouse
that, and that was not our strategy.''
