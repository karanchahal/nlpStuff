WASHINGTON _ Attempting to refute a central allegation in thegovernment's antitrust case, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday produceda secret e-mail message from the chairman of NetscapeCommunications Corp. seeking Microsoft's cooperation, offering tostay out of its way and suggesting that Microsoft invest inNetscape.The e-mail, written on Dec. 29, 1994, was introduced to suggestthat it was Netscape, not Microsoft, that initiated some of theelements of what the government portrays as an illegal offer byMicrosoft in June 1995 to divide with Netscape the market forsoftware used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.The e-mail message, written by James Clark, the chairman andcofounder of Netscape, was submitted in court Wednesday byMicrosoft as part of its defense in the sweeping antitrust suitfiled by the Justice Department and 20 states. It was perhaps themost surprising piece of evidence produced during a second day ofoften combative cross-examination of the government's leadingwitness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive ofNetscape.Throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, John Warden,Microsoft's lead lawyer, frequently tried to goad Barksdale toconcede key points in Microsoft's defense _ namely, that Netscape'sbrowser is widely distributed despite Microsoft's allegedly unfairbusiness practices, and that Microsoft's Internet Explorer browseronly began gaining market share against Netscape's Navigator in thefall of 1996, because Explorer had been significantly improved, notbecause of predatory conduct on the part of Microsoft.Barksdale made few concessions, repeatedly replying, ``No, Idon't agree.''In the e-mail memo to Dan Rosen, a Microsoft executive, Clarkwrote ``We have never planned to compete with you.''Later, Clark wrote, ``We want to make this company a success,but not at Microsoft's expense. We'd like to work with you. Workingtogether could be in your self-interest as well as ours. Dependingon the interest level, you might take an equity position inNetscape, with the ability to expand the position later.''Clark concluded his e-mail appeal by noting, ``No one in myorganization knows about this message.''Barksdale said he did not know about the e-mail until recentlyand that the first time he saw it was in court Wednesday. He saidthat Clark told him about his December 1994 proposal to Microsoftthis summer when Netscape executives were being deposed byMicrosoft's legal team in preparation for the trial.``He said that he made an offer to them including some of thisand that it was rejected,'' Barksdale testified.On the witness stand Wednesday, Barksdale sought to portray theDecember 1994 e-mail from Clark as a freelance overture that didnot represent corporate policy. ``He never discussed it with theboard, and he never discussed it with me,'' Barksdale said.Because Clark's offer was quickly dismissed by Microsoft, thegovernment asserts that its introduction in court by Microsoft ismainly an effort by the defense to try to ``change the facts andchange the subject,'' in the words of David Boies, special trialcounsel for the Justice Department.The December 1994 e-mail is not related, the governmentcontends, to the June 1995 meeting in which the Justice Departmentsays that Microsoft made its illegal offer. According to thegovernment, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape andgive Netscape's software developers crucial technical informationabout the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not tomake a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoftreleased two months later.The government says Netscape rejected Microsoft's collusionpact, while Microsoft replies that the government ismisrepresenting what was a routine business meeting.Clark sent his e-mail during Netscape's precarious startupphase, before the company had yet begun to garner a lot of salesand with Clark watching his $5 million investment in the companydwindle. In his testimony, Barksdale tried to dismiss the memo as asales ploy, perhaps made in desperation, as opposed to a genuinebusiness plan for Netscape.Warden asked Barksdale of Clark, ``Do you regard him as atruthful man?''After pausing, Barksdale replied, ``I regard him as asalesman.''``I'm not going to touch that,'' Warden responded.Microsoft also introduced a portion of Clark's pretrialdeposition to try to prove that as early as the fall of 1994Netscape was aware of Microsoft's intention to bundle its browserwith its Windows operating system.This is potentially significant because the government says thatMicrosoft's principal reason for folding the browser into theoperating system was as an anticompetitive tactic to undermineNetscape. In the fall of 1994, Microsoft asserts, Netscape had notyet produced its first product.In his deposition, Clark testified that he first heard BillGates, the chairman of Microsoft, talk of bundling the browser andthe operating system at an industry conference in October 1994.Clark was asked if he had a personal conversation with Gatesabout this, and Clark said no, instead recalling it as a vaguelythreatening comment made to the conference audience.``All he said was: I hope no one plans to make money on browsersbecause they will be bundled into the operating system,'' Clarksaid.In his cross-examination, Warden also tried to establish thatNetscape had long viewed all-but-free distribution of its browseras part of its business plan. This assertion relates to the casebecause Microsoft's decision to distribute its Internet Explorerbrowser free is characterized in the government's suit as one ofseveral extraordinarily aggressive steps Microsoft took to try toundercut Netscape.To make this point, Warden introduced as evidence portions ofthe manuscript from a new book, ``Competing on Internet Time:Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' by MichaelCusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology'sSloan School of Management, and David Yoffie, a professor at theHarvard business school.The book, based on extensive interviews with present and formerNetscape executives, quotes Marc Andreessen, a cofounder andexecutive vice president, as describing browser marketing as ``freebut not free.''The concept refers to the notion that many individuals andcorporations downloaded browser software from Netscape's Web sitewithout paying for it. Still, free distribution is valuable becauseit encourages companies to adopt Netscape's technology, andNetscape bases its business on selling large software packages forhub computers, or servers, that feed data to many personalcomputers in a network.Warden raised the issue to suggest that Netscape's businessmodel did not vary much from what Microsoft did.When asked about it, Barksdale replied, ``I have never heardthis term `free but not free.' I have not heard it, I don't espousethat, and that was not our strategy.''
