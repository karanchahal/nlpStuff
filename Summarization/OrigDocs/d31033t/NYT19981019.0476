WASHINGTON _ The government's case against Microsoft is anarrative that revolves around Netscape Communications Corp. andthe government's leading witness, James Barksdale, Netscape's55-year-old president and chief executive.In his 127 pages of written testimony, released Mondayafternoon, Barksdale supplied new details and a firsthandperspective of a disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape onJune 21, 1995, at Netscape's offices in Mountain View, Calif.At the meeting, the government contends, Microsoft executivesproposed that the two companies divvy up the emerging market forsoftware used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoftreplies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine businessmeeting.A longtime executive who has worked for IBM, Federal Express andAT&AMP;T, Barksdale described the June 1995 meeting as anything butroutine. ``I have never been in a meeting in my 35-year businesscareer in which a competitor had so blatantly implied that we wouldeither stop competing with it or the competitor would kill us,''Barksdale stated. ``In all my years in business, I have never heardnor experienced such an explicit proposal to divide markets.''If the court accepts Barksdale's version of the meeting, it willrepresent a big victory for the Justice Department and the 20states suing Microsoft. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could rulethat the meeting itself _ as a conspiracy to try to curbcompetition through collusion _ is an antitrust violation.And the government's broader case begins with that meeting.After Netscape spurned the offer, the government contends,Microsoft embarked on a strategy intended to thwart competition inthe Internet software market by crushing Netscape, bundling itsbrowser into its Windows operating system and making restrictivedeals with personal-computer makers, online services and othercompanies.Those tactics, the government says, represented an unfair use ofthe market power Microsoft has as a result of its monopoly inoperating-system software for personal computers. Microsoft, thegovernment adds, used that power to protect its monopoly positionand to extend its reach into the fast-growing new markets forInternet software and electronic commerce.The government focused on the June 1995 meeting in its antitrustsuit, filed in May, and since then additional information about themeeting has been reported. But in his lengthy statement, Barksdaleprovides, for the first time, a precise account of what he saysoccurred at the meeting. He quotes what Microsoft executives saidand refers to notes taken by another Netscape executive whoattended the meeting, Marc Andreessen.The two companies had held talks for months about cooperating.By the June meeting, Barksdale said, the cooperation Netscape mostsought was technical information from Microsoft that would enableNetscape's Navigator browser to run smoothly on top of Microsoft'sindustry-standard Windows operating system.At the meeting, Barksdale said, the Microsoft team, led by DanRosen, proposed that Netscape not market a browser for the Windows95 operating system, which was shipped two months later. As part ofthe proposal, Microsoft would also invest in Netscape and take aseat on the Netscape board.Barksdale asked if Netscape's ability to obtain technicalinformation from Microsoft was conditioned on Netscape's acceptingthe proposal. Barksdale quotes Rosen as saying, ``It certainlyisn't independent.'' Any technical information Netscape was seekingcould be obtained, Barksdale quotes a Microsoft executive assaying, ``depending on how we walk out of this room today.''If Netscape rejected Microsoft's deal, Barksdale testified, theMicrosoft team told Netscape that it could expect the technicalinformation to be delayed for three months _ meaning that thelatest version of Netscape's browser would not be ready for therelease of Windows 95.After declining Microsoft's offer, Netscape did not obtain thenecessary information until three months later, which Barksdalesays was ``precisely what Microsoft had threatened at the June 21meeting.''These allegations concerning technical information are legallysignificant because they portray Microsoft as using the power fromits operating-system dominance to reward allies and to punishrivals _ something Microsoft has consistently maintained it doesnot do.Andreessen, whose notes on his laptop computer are a vital pieceof the government's evidence, is said by Barksdale to be an``extraordinarily fast typist'' _ an aside clearly intended todeflect questions raised by Microsoft's lawyers about thecredibility of the notes.In his trial statement, Barksdale quoted these notes at lengthincluding Microsoft's effort to keep Netscape out of the Windows 95market for the browser _ or ``client'' in computer jargon. Typingall capital letters for emphasis, Andreessen wrote that Microsoftwanted to ``OWN THE WIN95 CLIENT MARKET AND THAT NETSCAPE SHOULDSTAY AWAY.''
