 
   WASHINGTON _ The government's case against Microsoft is a
narrative that revolves around Netscape Communications Corp. and
the government's leading witness, James Barksdale, Netscape's
55-year-old president and chief executive.
 
 
   In his 127 pages of written testimony, released Monday
afternoon, Barksdale supplied new details and a firsthand
perspective of a disputed meeting between Microsoft and Netscape on
June 21, 1995, at Netscape's offices in Mountain View, Calif.
 
 
   At the meeting, the government contends, Microsoft executives
proposed that the two companies divvy up the emerging market for
software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoft
replies that the prosecutors are misinterpreting a routine business
meeting.
 
 
   A longtime executive who has worked for IBM, Federal Express and
AT&AMP;T, Barksdale described the June 1995 meeting as anything but
routine. ``I have never been in a meeting in my 35-year business
career in which a competitor had so blatantly implied that we would
either stop competing with it or the competitor would kill us,''
Barksdale stated. ``In all my years in business, I have never heard
nor experienced such an explicit proposal to divide markets.''
 
 
   If the court accepts Barksdale's version of the meeting, it will
represent a big victory for the Justice Department and the 20
states suing Microsoft. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could rule
that the meeting itself _ as a conspiracy to try to curb
competition through collusion _ is an antitrust violation.
 
 
   And the government's broader case begins with that meeting.
After Netscape spurned the offer, the government contends,
Microsoft embarked on a strategy intended to thwart competition in
the Internet software market by crushing Netscape, bundling its
browser into its Windows operating system and making restrictive
deals with personal-computer makers, online services and other
companies.
 
 
   Those tactics, the government says, represented an unfair use of
the market power Microsoft has as a result of its monopoly in
operating-system software for personal computers. Microsoft, the
government adds, used that power to protect its monopoly position
and to extend its reach into the fast-growing new markets for
Internet software and electronic commerce.
 
 
   The government focused on the June 1995 meeting in its antitrust
suit, filed in May, and since then additional information about the
meeting has been reported. But in his lengthy statement, Barksdale
provides, for the first time, a precise account of what he says
occurred at the meeting. He quotes what Microsoft executives said
and refers to notes taken by another Netscape executive who
attended the meeting, Marc Andreessen.
 
 
   The two companies had held talks for months about cooperating.
By the June meeting, Barksdale said, the cooperation Netscape most
sought was technical information from Microsoft that would enable
Netscape's Navigator browser to run smoothly on top of Microsoft's
industry-standard Windows operating system.
 
 
   At the meeting, Barksdale said, the Microsoft team, led by Dan
Rosen, proposed that Netscape not market a browser for the Windows
95 operating system, which was shipped two months later. As part of
the proposal, Microsoft would also invest in Netscape and take a
seat on the Netscape board.
 
 
   Barksdale asked if Netscape's ability to obtain technical
information from Microsoft was conditioned on Netscape's accepting
the proposal. Barksdale quotes Rosen as saying, ``It certainly
isn't independent.'' Any technical information Netscape was seeking
could be obtained, Barksdale quotes a Microsoft executive as
saying, ``depending on how we walk out of this room today.''
 
 
   If Netscape rejected Microsoft's deal, Barksdale testified, the
Microsoft team told Netscape that it could expect the technical
information to be delayed for three months _ meaning that the
latest version of Netscape's browser would not be ready for the
release of Windows 95.
 
 
   After declining Microsoft's offer, Netscape did not obtain the
necessary information until three months later, which Barksdale
says was ``precisely what Microsoft had threatened at the June 21
meeting.''
 
 
   These allegations concerning technical information are legally
significant because they portray Microsoft as using the power from
its operating-system dominance to reward allies and to punish
rivals _ something Microsoft has consistently maintained it does
not do.
 
 
   Andreessen, whose notes on his laptop computer are a vital piece
of the government's evidence, is said by Barksdale to be an
``extraordinarily fast typist'' _ an aside clearly intended to
deflect questions raised by Microsoft's lawyers about the
credibility of the notes.
 
 
   In his trial statement, Barksdale quoted these notes at length
including Microsoft's effort to keep Netscape out of the Windows 95
market for the browser _ or ``client'' in computer jargon. Typing
all capital letters for emphasis, Andreessen wrote that Microsoft
wanted to ``OWN THE WIN95 CLIENT MARKET AND THAT NETSCAPE SHOULD
STAY AWAY.''
