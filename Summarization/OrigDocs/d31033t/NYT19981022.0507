 
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayed
the company's competitor in the Internet software business,
Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participant
in deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which the
government and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered to
divide the market.
 
 
   That meeting and the charge of an illegal offer to divide the
market for Internet browsers, the software used to navigate the
World Wide Web, are central elements of the antitrust suit by the
Justice Department and 20 states being heard in United States
district court here.
 
 
   Late in the day, the Justice Department made public an e-mail
that seemed to support elements of the government's account.
 
 
   The memo, from Dan Rosen, a senior Microsoft executive who
attended the meeting with Netscape's leaders, was written to Bill
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and others. It summarizes the meeting
and begins with a list of ``Our goals going into the meeting, in
priority order.''
 
 
   The first goal, the memo said, was to ``establish Microsoft
ownership'' of the market for Web browsers that run on Windows
computers.
 
 
   In his third day cross-examining James L. Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive, the Microsoft lawyer, John Warden,
suggested that the market-division allegation stemmed from anger on
the part of Netscape executives when they learned at that meeting
that Microsoft intended to bundle its own browser with its Windows
operating system.
 
 
   ``Is there really anything going on here other than a difference
of opinion between you and Microsoft on where the line is'' between
a browser and an operating system? Warden asked.
 
 
   At that Barksdale _ normally a calm and unerringly polite
witness _ exploded: ``We feel strongly that a browser is a separate
application, and a manufacturer that controls 90 percent, plus, of
the world's operating systems and pulls the browser into it has
stepped across that line!''
 
 
   ``That's your objection?'' Warden asked. ``You disagree with
them building it into the operating system?''
 
 
   ``I do, I do, I do,'' Barksdale said.
 
 
   Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft of
trying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21,
1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers. If
they did not agree, the government says, Microsoft threatened to
destroy Netscape. Such a collusion to divide markets would be a
violation of federal antitrust law.
 
 
   When Netscape refused, the government further charges, Microsoft
decided to bundle its own Web browser, Internet Explorer, with the
Windows system to drive Netscape out of the browser business.
Windows runs more than 90 percent of all new personal computers.
 
 
   In court Thursday, Microsoft presented memos and e-mail messages
suggesting that Netscape had eagerly sought the June meeting.
Barksdale acknowledged that he had written memos to other Netscape
executives in early June 1995 in which he had enthusiastically
reported that in an earlier meeting, Microsoft had shown an
interest in investing in his company.
 
 
   ``No, they didn't do anything as rash as trying to buy us (yet)
but they did suggest that they wanted to invest in us,'' Barksdale
wrote to another employee three weeks before the meeting. ``It was
a good session.''
 
 
   Another memo from Barksdale to several senior Netscape employees
reported that Microsoft had been ``very friendly, nonthreatening''
and had congratulated Netscape on having ``done a great job.''
 
 
   As Barksdale's e-mail recounted it, the Microsoft executives had
added, ``How can we work together? Discussion done with Bill's
blessing,'' a reference to Gates.
 
 
   With that as a prelude, Warden, Microsoft's lead counsel in the
case, produced several other e-mail messages and memos suggesting
that Netscape and Microsoft had both plunged into planning for the
June 21 meeting.
 
 
   Warden used each to cast further doubt on the government's
allegations. One piece of documentary evidence indicating that
Microsoft did propose dividing the browser market are notes that
Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and executive vice president of
Netscape, took on his laptop computer during the meeting.
 
 
   A copy of those notes was released Thursday by the court.
 
 
   Andreessen wrote that Microsoft had issued a ``threat that
Microsoft will own the Windows 95 client market, and that Netscape
should stay away.''
 
 
   Another piece of evidence is the memo from Rosen to Gates,
written the day after the meeting. Rosen quotes another member of
the Micrsoft team as telling the Netscape executives: ``We need to
understand if you will adopt our platform,'' Windows, ``and build
on top if it, or if you are going to compete with us.''
 
 
   The memo continued, ``They understand that we are going to
incorporate into the platform technology that they provide today.''
The Microsoft executives, according to Rosen's memo, told
Netscape's leaders that their intention was to ``suck most of the
functionality of the current Netscape browser'' into Windows.
 
 
   But Rosen's memo did not indicate that the Netscape executives
had reacted negatively to this.
 
 
   The memo was introduced into evidence Thursday, but not referred
to in court.
 
 
   In fact, summing up his conclusions after three days of
testimony, Warden said, ``I suggest to you, Barksdale, that if you
look at the whole record of events leading up to June 21, the only
fair conclusion that can be reached is that Andreessen imagined or
invented the proposal to divide the markets, and that you and your
company signed onto it in order to assist in this prosecution.''
 
 
   ``I absolutely disagree with that,'' Barksdale retorted. ``It's
absurd. I was in the meeting. I know what I know.
 
 
   ``I was there,'' he said. ``You weren't.''
