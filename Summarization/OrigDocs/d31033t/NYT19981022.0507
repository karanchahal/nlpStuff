WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for Microsoft Corp. on Thursday portrayedthe company's competitor in the Internet software business,Netscape Communications Corp., as a willing and eager participantin deal-making that culminated in a June 1995 meeting at which thegovernment and Netscape now say that Microsoft illegally offered todivide the market.That meeting and the charge of an illegal offer to divide themarket for Internet browsers, the software used to navigate theWorld Wide Web, are central elements of the antitrust suit by theJustice Department and 20 states being heard in United Statesdistrict court here.Late in the day, the Justice Department made public an e-mailthat seemed to support elements of the government's account.The memo, from Dan Rosen, a senior Microsoft executive whoattended the meeting with Netscape's leaders, was written to BillGates, Microsoft's chairman, and others. It summarizes the meetingand begins with a list of ``Our goals going into the meeting, inpriority order.''The first goal, the memo said, was to ``establish Microsoftownership'' of the market for Web browsers that run on Windowscomputers.In his third day cross-examining James L. Barksdale, Netscape'spresident and chief executive, the Microsoft lawyer, John Warden,suggested that the market-division allegation stemmed from anger onthe part of Netscape executives when they learned at that meetingthat Microsoft intended to bundle its own browser with its Windowsoperating system.``Is there really anything going on here other than a differenceof opinion between you and Microsoft on where the line is'' betweena browser and an operating system? Warden asked.At that Barksdale _ normally a calm and unerringly politewitness _ exploded: ``We feel strongly that a browser is a separateapplication, and a manufacturer that controls 90 percent, plus, ofthe world's operating systems and pulls the browser into it hasstepped across that line!''``That's your objection?'' Warden asked. ``You disagree withthem building it into the operating system?''``I do, I do, I do,'' Barksdale said.Among other charges, the government's suit accuses Microsoft oftrying to persuade Netscape executives, at the meeting on June 21,1995, to quit marketing browsers that run on Windows computers. Ifthey did not agree, the government says, Microsoft threatened todestroy Netscape. Such a collusion to divide markets would be aviolation of federal antitrust law.When Netscape refused, the government further charges, Microsoftdecided to bundle its own Web browser, Internet Explorer, with theWindows system to drive Netscape out of the browser business.Windows runs more than 90 percent of all new personal computers.In court Thursday, Microsoft presented memos and e-mail messagessuggesting that Netscape had eagerly sought the June meeting.Barksdale acknowledged that he had written memos to other Netscapeexecutives in early June 1995 in which he had enthusiasticallyreported that in an earlier meeting, Microsoft had shown aninterest in investing in his company.``No, they didn't do anything as rash as trying to buy us (yet)but they did suggest that they wanted to invest in us,'' Barksdalewrote to another employee three weeks before the meeting. ``It wasa good session.''Another memo from Barksdale to several senior Netscape employeesreported that Microsoft had been ``very friendly, nonthreatening''and had congratulated Netscape on having ``done a great job.''As Barksdale's e-mail recounted it, the Microsoft executives hadadded, ``How can we work together? Discussion done with Bill'sblessing,'' a reference to Gates.With that as a prelude, Warden, Microsoft's lead counsel in thecase, produced several other e-mail messages and memos suggestingthat Netscape and Microsoft had both plunged into planning for theJune 21 meeting.Warden used each to cast further doubt on the government'sallegations. One piece of documentary evidence indicating thatMicrosoft did propose dividing the browser market are notes thatMarc Andreessen, a cofounder and executive vice president ofNetscape, took on his laptop computer during the meeting.A copy of those notes was released Thursday by the court.Andreessen wrote that Microsoft had issued a ``threat thatMicrosoft will own the Windows 95 client market, and that Netscapeshould stay away.''Another piece of evidence is the memo from Rosen to Gates,written the day after the meeting. Rosen quotes another member ofthe Micrsoft team as telling the Netscape executives: ``We need tounderstand if you will adopt our platform,'' Windows, ``and buildon top if it, or if you are going to compete with us.''The memo continued, ``They understand that we are going toincorporate into the platform technology that they provide today.''The Microsoft executives, according to Rosen's memo, toldNetscape's leaders that their intention was to ``suck most of thefunctionality of the current Netscape browser'' into Windows.But Rosen's memo did not indicate that the Netscape executiveshad reacted negatively to this.The memo was introduced into evidence Thursday, but not referredto in court.In fact, summing up his conclusions after three days oftestimony, Warden said, ``I suggest to you, Barksdale, that if youlook at the whole record of events leading up to June 21, the onlyfair conclusion that can be reached is that Andreessen imagined orinvented the proposal to divide the markets, and that you and yourcompany signed onto it in order to assist in this prosecution.''``I absolutely disagree with that,'' Barksdale retorted. ``It'sabsurd. I was in the meeting. I know what I know.``I was there,'' he said. ``You weren't.''
