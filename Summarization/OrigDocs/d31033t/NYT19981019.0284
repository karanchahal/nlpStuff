WASHINGTON _ After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trialagainst the Microsoft Corp. opened in federal court Monday morningwith a pointed personal attack on Bill Gates, the company'schairman, who testified in a taped deposition that he knew littleif anything about the key charges leveled against his company bythe Justice Department and 20 states.``My only knowledge is the Wall Street Journal article; itsurprised me'' Gates said of reports of a meeting in which hiscompany had offered its chief competitor in Internet software achance to divide the market. Gazing directly at his questioner,brow furrowed, head tilted slightly to the left, he added, ``I wasnot involved'' in discussions of the key meetings.But as the Justice Department proceeded with its openingargument over the next two hours, its lead lawyer in the case,David Boies, presented more than a dozen memos and e-mail messageswritten by Gates over the last three years, showing clearly that heand other senior Microsoft executives not only knew about thematters in question but had forcefully directed them.Using memos and documents, the government portrayed a companyobsessed with crushing its competitor, the Netscape CommunicationsCorp., and willing to use every tool at its disposal, includingthreats and financial inducements, to force or persuade othercompanies to drop any planned or existing alliances with Netscape.Gates told his questioner at another point in the depositionthat he had not even read the government's antitrust suit. As toits central charge, illegal collusion to divide software markets,Gates said only: ``I think somebody said that was in there.''Gates also said that in 1995, ``somebody came to me to ask if itmade sense investing in Netscape.'' Shaking his head dismissively,Gates recalled, ``I said it didn't make any sense to me.''Moments later, Boies displayed on a 10-foot video screen andenlargement of a memo in which Gates wrote to Paul Meritz, a seniorMicrosoft executive, that over time Microsoft might have to competewith Netscape. ``But in the meantime we can help them,'' Gateswrote. ``We can pay them some money.''At the heart of this competition _ and central to the case _ arebrowsing programs used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.Netscape got an early lead in the market with its Navigatorbrowser. What frightened Microsoft was that Navigator could also beused as a ``platform,'' a layer of software on which other programscan run. This is the main function of an operating system, a marketin which Microsoft has a monopoly with its Windows family ofoperating systems.Leaving the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, William H.Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president of law and governmentaffairs, said that the government's opening presentation was``based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and snippets thatwere not in any reliable context.'' Microsoft will offer its ownopening remarks on Tuesday.``These are the same tired old allegations,'' Neukomb said.``None of these snippets, none of this rhetoric even approachesproof of anti-competitive conduct.''Earlier, however, Boies had told the judge, ``It's competitionon the merits that the antitrust laws foster. But this is not asituation of competition on the merits. This is a situation, Irespectfully submit, your honor, of clear restraint of trade.''In one 1995 e-mail message relating to Microsoft's effort topush Netscape out of the market for browsers that run on Windowscomputers, Gates wrote other Microsoft executives: ``I think thereis a very powerful deal we can make with Netscape. I would reallylike to see something like this happen!!'' Other memos showed thatGates was continually and personally involved.In an attempt to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitivebehavior, Boies led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. DistrictCourt through a chronology of memos and messages that seemed toshow Microsoft threatening and cajoling other companies.(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)After a meeting with Gates in 1996, an executive with AmericaOnline, the nation's largest on-line service, wrote to otherexecutives in his company: ``Gates delivered a characteristicallyblunt query: `How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?This is your lucky day.'''In the summer of 1995, one memo showed, Gates wrote to AndrewGrove, chairman of the Intel Corp., and bluntly asked why thecompany was doing software research that might conflict withMicrsoft's plans.``I don't understand why Intel funds a program that is againstWindows,'' the message said. An Intel note a few weeks later said,``Gates made vague threats about supporting'' Intel's competitors,unless Intel agreed to shut down its software research.Intel eventually relented, but while this standoff was underway,a Microsoft memo said, the nation's computer-manufacturing industrywas paralyzed while awaiting word on whether Microsoft deemed itacceptable to use certain features of a new computer chip Intel wasselling. Gates wrote: ``This is good news. It means they arelistening to us.''In another case, the memos indicated that Microsoft threatenedto stop selling the Apple Computer Co. a version of Microsoft'sOffice software suite, which holds more than 90 percent of thatmarket _ unless Apple stopped supporting Netscape.A central argument in the government's suit is that Microsofthas bundled its Web browser with Windows as a tactic in its warwith Netscape. For the last year, at least, Microsoft has arguedthat the browser was added to Windows only for the benefit ofcustomers.In court Monday, however, the Justice Department displayednumerous internal memos indicating that the bundling was indeed atactical decision. The memos showed that Microsoft's leaders firstwanted to sell Interent Explorer and expected to earn $120 milliona year from the sales. Then, when the plan to push Netscape out ofcompetition with Microsoft failed, the company's leaders decided tobundle the browser with Windows instead as a means of helping itgain a majority share of the market.In one memo, written in December 1995 _ in the thick ofMicrosoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market _ Gates wrotea memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape wasdesigning browser software ``far better than we are.''In an interview a few months later, displayed in court Monday,Gates said: ``Our business model works even if the InternetExplorer software is free. We are still selling operating systems.What's Netscape's business model look like in that case? Not verygood.''The government also proffered several memos from computermanufacturers complaining bitterly about Microsoft's licensingrestriction that prohibited them from offering Netscape if theywanted to offer Windows.``We're very disappointed,'' Hewlett Packard wrote to Microsoftlast year. ``This will cause significant, costly problems. From aconsumer perspective, it is hurting our industry.``If we had another choice of another supplier, based on youractions here, we would take it.''
