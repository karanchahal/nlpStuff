 
   WASHINGTON _ After months of noisy prelude, the antitrust trial
against the Microsoft Corp. opened in federal court Monday morning
with a pointed personal attack on Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, who testified in a taped deposition that he knew little
if anything about the key charges leveled against his company by
the Justice Department and 20 states.
 
 
   ``My only knowledge is the Wall Street Journal article; it
surprised me'' Gates said of reports of a meeting in which his
company had offered its chief competitor in Internet software a
chance to divide the market. Gazing directly at his questioner,
brow furrowed, head tilted slightly to the left, he added, ``I was
not involved'' in discussions of the key meetings.
 
 
   But as the Justice Department proceeded with its opening
argument over the next two hours, its lead lawyer in the case,
David Boies, presented more than a dozen memos and e-mail messages
written by Gates over the last three years, showing clearly that he
and other senior Microsoft executives not only knew about the
matters in question but had forcefully directed them.
 
 
   Using memos and documents, the government portrayed a company
obsessed with crushing its competitor, the Netscape Communications
Corp., and willing to use every tool at its disposal, including
threats and financial inducements, to force or persuade other
companies to drop any planned or existing alliances with Netscape.
 
 
   Gates told his questioner at another point in the deposition
that he had not even read the government's antitrust suit. As to
its central charge, illegal collusion to divide software markets,
Gates said only: ``I think somebody said that was in there.''
 
 
   Gates also said that in 1995, ``somebody came to me to ask if it
made sense investing in Netscape.'' Shaking his head dismissively,
Gates recalled, ``I said it didn't make any sense to me.''
 
 
   Moments later, Boies displayed on a 10-foot video screen and
enlargement of a memo in which Gates wrote to Paul Meritz, a senior
Microsoft executive, that over time Microsoft might have to compete
with Netscape. ``But in the meantime we can help them,'' Gates
wrote. ``We can pay them some money.''
 
 
   At the heart of this competition _ and central to the case _ are
browsing programs used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
Netscape got an early lead in the market with its Navigator
browser. What frightened Microsoft was that Navigator could also be
used as a ``platform,'' a layer of software on which other programs
can run. This is the main function of an operating system, a market
in which Microsoft has a monopoly with its Windows family of
operating systems.
 
 
   Leaving the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, William H.
Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president of law and government
affairs, said that the government's opening presentation was
``based entirely on loose and unreliable rhetoric and snippets that
were not in any reliable context.'' Microsoft will offer its own
opening remarks on Tuesday.
 
 
   ``These are the same tired old allegations,'' Neukomb said.
``None of these snippets, none of this rhetoric even approaches
proof of anti-competitive conduct.''
 
 
   Earlier, however, Boies had told the judge, ``It's competition
on the merits that the antitrust laws foster. But this is not a
situation of competition on the merits. This is a situation, I
respectfully submit, your honor, of clear restraint of trade.''
 
 
   In one 1995 e-mail message relating to Microsoft's effort to
push Netscape out of the market for browsers that run on Windows
computers, Gates wrote other Microsoft executives: ``I think there
is a very powerful deal we can make with Netscape. I would really
like to see something like this happen!!'' Other memos showed that
Gates was continually and personally involved.
 
 
   In an attempt to demonstrate a pattern of anticompetitive
behavior, Boies led Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District
Court through a chronology of memos and messages that seemed to
show Microsoft threatening and cajoling other companies.
 
 
   After a meeting with Gates in 1996, an executive with America
Online, the nation's largest on-line service, wrote to other
executives in his company: ``Gates delivered a characteristically
blunt query: `How much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?
This is your lucky day.'''
 
 
   In the summer of 1995, one memo showed, Gates wrote to Andrew
Grove, chairman of the Intel Corp., and bluntly asked why the
company was doing software research that might conflict with
Micrsoft's plans.
 
 
   ``I don't understand why Intel funds a program that is against
Windows,'' the message said. An Intel note a few weeks later said,
``Gates made vague threats about supporting'' Intel's competitors,
unless Intel agreed to shut down its software research.
 
 
   Intel eventually relented, but while this standoff was underway,
a Microsoft memo said, the nation's computer-manufacturing industry
was paralyzed while awaiting word on whether Microsoft deemed it
acceptable to use certain features of a new computer chip Intel was
selling. Gates wrote: ``This is good news. It means they are
listening to us.''
 
 
   In another case, the memos indicated that Microsoft threatened
to stop selling the Apple Computer Co. a version of Microsoft's
Office software suite, which holds more than 90 percent of that
market _ unless Apple stopped supporting Netscape.
 
 
   A central argument in the government's suit is that Microsoft
has bundled its Web browser with Windows as a tactic in its war
with Netscape. For the last year, at least, Microsoft has argued
that the browser was added to Windows only for the benefit of
customers.
 
 
   In court Monday, however, the Justice Department displayed
numerous internal memos indicating that the bundling was indeed a
tactical decision. The memos showed that Microsoft's leaders first
wanted to sell Interent Explorer and expected to earn $120 million
a year from the sales. Then, when the plan to push Netscape out of
competition with Microsoft failed, the company's leaders decided to
bundle the browser with Windows instead as a means of helping it
gain a majority share of the market.
 
 
   In one memo, written in December 1995 _ in the thick of
Microsoft's effort to push Netscape out of the market _ Gates wrote
a memo to others in the company acknowledging that Netscape was
designing browser software ``far better than we are.''
 
 
   In an interview a few months later, displayed in court Monday,
Gates said: ``Our business model works even if the Internet
Explorer software is free. We are still selling operating systems.
What's Netscape's business model look like in that case? Not very
good.''
 
 
   The government also proffered several memos from computer
manufacturers complaining bitterly about Microsoft's licensing
restriction that prohibited them from offering Netscape if they
wanted to offer Windows.
 
 
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Hewlett Packard wrote to Microsoft
last year. ``This will cause significant, costly problems. From a
consumer perspective, it is hurting our industry.
 
 
   ``If we had another choice of another supplier, based on your
actions here, we would take it.''
