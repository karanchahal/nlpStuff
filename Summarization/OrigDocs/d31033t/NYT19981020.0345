Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, theMicrosoft Corp. Tuesday reported that its quarterly earnings hadrisen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceedingWall Street estimates.Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, saiddemand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded itsprojections, particularly in Japan and Europe.Microsoft's improved performance coincided with the beginningstages of a landmark antitrust trial in Washington that couldthreaten its dominance in computer software.The company, which the Department of Justice has portrayed as aruthless and unfair competitor, said its strength in the latestquarter was derived mostly from Windows 98, which was released justlast June, and the Windows NT corporate operating system.The results for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash.,were released after the stock market had closed. In NASDAQ trading,Microsoft shares closed at $100.25, down $2.69, which may havereflected the opening of the antitrust trial on Monday. But inafter-hours trading, the shares traded as high as $103.75.``Business is good, so the doom-and-gloom scenario of someeconomic prognosticators certainly hasn't come to pass,'' GregMaffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephoneinterview. ``This is not just for Microsoft, but the whole PCindustry.''Despite the widespread economic problems in much of the world,Maffei noted, the six largest software companies and eight largestcomputer and chip companies that have reported earnings have allbeaten estimates.While continuing to urge caution about the outlook, as Microsoftexecutives do each quarter, Maffei said the company was likely todo better than expected in the second fiscal quarter as well. Hesaid he would advise securities analysts to adjust their estimatesupward.For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Microsoft earned $1.68 billion,or 62 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $663 million, or25 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a year ago.Revenues rose 26 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.The latest results included a $160 million one-time gain on thesale of Softimage, while in the comparable quarter last year thecompany took a previously announced $296 million write-off relatedto the purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. Without these one-timeitems, Microsoft's earnings rose to $1.52 billion, or 56 cents ashare, compared to the previous year's $959 million, or 36 cents ashare, to record the 58 percent gain.Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earningsresults, had expected Microsoft to earn 49 cents a share.``It was a terrific quarter, a real blowout, a very pleasantsurprise for Microsoft shareholders,'' said Rick Sherlund, ananalyst with Goldman Sachs. Microsoft's results ``benefited frommuch higher margins,'' he said. ``We had a combination of betterthan expected revenues and lower than expected expenses in thequarter,'' he said.Maffei said the improved profit margins were partly a seasonalphenomenon because the company does less hiring during the summerand the marketing costs associated with the launch of Windows 98were largely in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1998.Also, service costs are lower for Windows 98 than for Windows95. ``We had better than expected revenues, and we were at the lowend of our spending,'' he said.Although the antitrust suit brought against Microsoft by theUnited States Department of Justice did not affect earnings, Maffeisaid, it does have a direct cost in increased legal spending.``That's a large cost, but not a material cost,'' he said. ``Wedo worry about the continued cost of the DOJ's image blasting.''Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside toreflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to$3.13 billion in the quarter, up $245 million from a year ago. Cashand short-term investments totaled $17.24 billion, compared with$13.93 billion a year ago.On a cautionary note, Maffei said fallout from the Asianeconomic crisis remains a concern and the company is uncertainabout future performance in Latin American countries. Corporatespending for computer issues related to the year 2000 may divertrevenues away from some Microsoft products but could benefitothers, he said.
