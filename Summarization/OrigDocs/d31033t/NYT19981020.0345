 
   Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, the
Microsoft Corp. Tuesday reported that its quarterly earnings had
risen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceeding
Wall Street estimates.
 
 
   Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, said
demand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded its
projections, particularly in Japan and Europe.
 
 
   Microsoft's improved performance coincided with the beginning
stages of a landmark antitrust trial in Washington that could
threaten its dominance in computer software.
 
 
   The company, which the Department of Justice has portrayed as a
ruthless and unfair competitor, said its strength in the latest
quarter was derived mostly from Windows 98, which was released just
last June, and the Windows NT corporate operating system.
 
 
   The results for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash.,
were released after the stock market had closed. In NASDAQ trading,
Microsoft shares closed at $100.25, down $2.69, which may have
reflected the opening of the antitrust trial on Monday. But in
after-hours trading, the shares traded as high as $103.75.
 
 
   ``Business is good, so the doom-and-gloom scenario of some
economic prognosticators certainly hasn't come to pass,'' Greg
Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephone
interview. ``This is not just for Microsoft, but the whole PC
industry.''
 
 
   Despite the widespread economic problems in much of the world,
Maffei noted, the six largest software companies and eight largest
computer and chip companies that have reported earnings have all
beaten estimates.
 
 
   While continuing to urge caution about the outlook, as Microsoft
executives do each quarter, Maffei said the company was likely to
do better than expected in the second fiscal quarter as well. He
said he would advise securities analysts to adjust their estimates
upward.
 
 
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Microsoft earned $1.68 billion,
or 62 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $663 million, or
25 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues rose 26 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.
 
 
   The latest results included a $160 million one-time gain on the
sale of Softimage, while in the comparable quarter last year the
company took a previously announced $296 million write-off related
to the purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. Without these one-time
items, Microsoft's earnings rose to $1.52 billion, or 56 cents a
share, compared to the previous year's $959 million, or 36 cents a
share, to record the 58 percent gain.
 
 
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
results, had expected Microsoft to earn 49 cents a share.
 
 
   ``It was a terrific quarter, a real blowout, a very pleasant
surprise for Microsoft shareholders,'' said Rick Sherlund, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs. Microsoft's results ``benefited from
much higher margins,'' he said. ``We had a combination of better
than expected revenues and lower than expected expenses in the
quarter,'' he said.
 
 
   Maffei said the improved profit margins were partly a seasonal
phenomenon because the company does less hiring during the summer
and the marketing costs associated with the launch of Windows 98
were largely in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1998.
 
 
   Also, service costs are lower for Windows 98 than for Windows
95. ``We had better than expected revenues, and we were at the low
end of our spending,'' he said.
 
 
   Although the antitrust suit brought against Microsoft by the
United States Department of Justice did not affect earnings, Maffei
said, it does have a direct cost in increased legal spending.
 
 
   ``That's a large cost, but not a material cost,'' he said. ``We
do worry about the continued cost of the DOJ's image blasting.''
 
 
   Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to
reflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to
$3.13 billion in the quarter, up $245 million from a year ago. Cash
and short-term investments totaled $17.24 billion, compared with
$13.93 billion a year ago.
 
 
   On a cautionary note, Maffei said fallout from the Asian
economic crisis remains a concern and the company is uncertain
about future performance in Latin American countries. Corporate
spending for computer issues related to the year 2000 may divert
revenues away from some Microsoft products but could benefit
others, he said.
