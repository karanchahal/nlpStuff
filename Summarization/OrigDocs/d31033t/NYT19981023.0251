WASHINGTON _ The New Economy is on trial here along withMicrosoft Corp.Sure, the company is the one in the dock. But the outcome of thecase against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how thedoctrine of antitrust will apply to high-technology fields likecomputer software. And the software industry is seen as being atthe forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies andmarkets that define the New Economy.In the New Economy, people live on Internet time and productcycles are measured in months, not years. It is the slice of theeconomy driven by entrepreneurs, stock options and network effects.Silicon Valley is its headquarters, with subsidiaries in Seattle,Austin and elsewhere. It is the future, its proponents insist,coming to your home soon.If Microsoft wins, the digital age will unfold as a free-firezone of let-'er-rip capitalism, for better or worse. If Microsoftloses, courts or the antitrust watchdogs may be getting their oarsinto such complex matters as product design, for better or worse.Let the courts decide. But for an analytic examination ofstruggle and competition at the edge of the New Economy today, anew book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape andIts Battle with Microsoft'' (The Free Press), offers someintriguing insights. The book, written by Michael A. Cusumano, aprofessor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's SloanSchool of Management, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at theHarvard Business School, was placed in evidence at the Microsofttrial last week.In its defense, Microsoft points to passages in the book inwhich executives of Netscape Communications are quoted speakingcandidly about their missteps. Microsoft calls these statementsproof that Netscape's travails in the Internet browser market wereits own doing, not because Microsoft was acting like a nastymonopolist.Yet the book as a whole reads as a coming-of-age account of thetriumphs and setbacks of a fast-moving Internet pioneer daring orfoolish enough to take on the dominant company in computing.Netscape's experience teaches as much about what hasn't changed aswhat has.A fundamental lesson is that even revolutionary technologiestake time to cause a revolution. No matter how great the tail windof hype and venture capital, the Next Big Thing takes time tochange the practices and habits of companies and people. ``Netscapegot too ambitious and too wedded to the belief that the Internetrevolution would change everything tomorrow,'' Yoffie explained.The threat Netscape posed to Microsoft was that its browsercould serve as an alternative ``platform'' to Microsoft's Windows.In other words, the browser could take the place of Windows as thefirst thing users see when they start their computers and as thedeparture point from which applications could be started.But it takes a long time for a new computing platform to catchhold, as thousands of software programmers gradually becomeconverts and write applications that work with the new platform. Byoften and publicly declaring that it was going to challengeMicrosoft head-on, Netscape aroused the software giant, whichtrailed in Internet software. ``Netscape had the perfect Trojanhorse,'' Yoffie said. ``But it woke up the enemy before it wasentrenched.''As it matured, Netscape also found that while the speed ofproduct development was important, so was traditional productquality. Netscape's freewheeling ``hacker culture'' fosteredflexibility and creativity _ one Netscape manager quoted in thebook described its development style as ``slightly out of control''_ but also led to buggy software, a nuisance that becameproblematic with more sales to quality-conscious corporations.In the last year or so, the authors note, Netscape has madestrides in quality, hiring testers and increasing its use ofautomated testing software. Netscape has increased its ratio oftesters to developers from one-to-five to one-to-three, though itstill trails Microsoft's one-to-one ratio. ``You can be fast andflexible in software development, but you have to pay the price intesting,'' Cusumano said.Netscape's future is by no means assured. But for all the talkat the trial about Microsoft trying to crush it, Netscape has donea good job of changing its strategy to avoid tackling Microsofthead-on whenever possible.What Netscape, the Internet pioneer, has learned _ setting asidethe legal issues _ is precisely what the pioneers of thepersonal-computer revolution learned. They declared that theirtechnology would change the world, but the process works in theother direction, too. For a breakthrough technology to move intothe mainstream, it must become more mainstream _ easier, morereliable and more useful for the workaday chores of the economy. Itdoes not change everything overnight.
