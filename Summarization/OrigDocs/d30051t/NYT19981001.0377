GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia _ A 42-year-old man who says he is thelone survivor of a massacre in which 13 ethnic Albanians weresummarily shot and killed in this village in Kosovo recalledThursday how he was herded into a garden with other men and told tolie flat on the ground.Heads to the fence, feet toward the house! Serbian policemenbarked, he recounted.Then, the severely wounded man said as he recounted the talefrom his mattress on the floor of his home Thursday, police kickedthe prone men with their boots and beat them with the woodenhandles of shovels.``They kept yelling, `Who among you is Kosovo Liberation Army?If you tell us, we will release everyone else,''' the man recalledof the events of last Saturday.Then, he said, the shooting started. First, the man to his rightwas shot, then two men farther down the row. And then the whole rowfrom left to right, then down the row again, from right to left.``After the two shots for each man, they kicked one, and he wasalive.'' he said. ``They shot him again. When they kicked me, Ididn't move.''The survivor, the father of eight children, was advised byWestern diplomats who interviewed him on Tuesday and by aresearcher for Human Rights Watch who saw him Thursday not to givehis name to a reporter for fear of jeopardizing his safety.The diplomats and the researcher for the New York-based rightsorganization said the man could suffer reprisals from Serbianpolicemen who are at checkpoints on the roads and in the hillsaround the village if he revealed his identity.But they said that because of the clarity and first-hand natureof the man's evidence, they consider him a key potential witnessfor a proceeding at the international war crimes tribunal in TheHague.The killing of the men and the massacre of 18 members of anAlbanian family on the same day in villages about four miles apartin the Drenica region of Kosovo, a province where guerrillas arefighting for independence from Serbia, prompted calls from Westernleaders for war-crimes investigations by The Hague tribunal.Washington called on the government of the Yugoslav president,Slobodan Milosevic, to allow impartial forensic experts to visitthe sites to determine what happened. The Milosevic government hasdenounced the war crimes tribunal and consistently denied access toforensic experts, asserting that there was no need for them becauseno war crimes had occurred.Two investigators from the war crimes tribunal who have been inKosovo for a week were expected to see the survivor Thursday. Butthe investigators who got into Kosovo, after long negotiations withthe Yugoslavia government for their visas, left for Belgrade, thecapital, Thursday without interviewing the survivor or inspectingthe site where the Deliaj family was massacred.A spokesman at The Hague, Jim Landale, said he had noinformation on why the investigators left before pursuing the twocases. ``We are confirming that we are investigating theseincidents,'' he said.The researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert, who hasexperience in interviewing survivors of atrocities in Africa, saidafter listening to the man's account that the coherence of hisstory and his lack of exaggeration made him an important witnessfor the tribunal. Significantly, he said, details of the storytallied with evidence in the garden of spent bullets from anautomatic weapon and pools of blood along the fence.The executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, saidin New York Thursday that it was troubling that the tribunal hadnot seized the opportunity to listen to the survivor or inspect thetwo killing sites. ``This is not a historical inquiry,'' Roth saidof the tribunal.The survivor, who has a shock of black hair and full blackmustache, has essentially been a captive in his house since hehobbled the half-mile back home Saturday afternoon. He is toofrightened to go to the hospital even though his leg wound reachesto the bone and gangrene is starting to develop. His left arm isalso wounded from the second bullet.The International Committee for the Red Cross visited him onTuesday with some bandages and medicines but has not been backsince, he said.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)The man described the events leading up to the shootings as theclimax of a Serbian attack on the village that began last Fridaymorning with shelling from across the hills. Men, women andchildren fled to the forest and spent the night under the trees.On Saturday morning, he said, everyone was ordered by Serbianforces to come out of the forest and gather in a field. The womenand children were separated from the men, and then the men werewhittled down into a smaller group.There were about ``30 to 40 police'' doing the sorting of themen, he said. They wore the blue camouflage uniforms of the Serbiansecurity police, and some had yellow insignia on their shoulderssignifying rank, he said. Some wore black bandannas around theirforeheads.Asked if there was one person in charge, he said: ``I don'tknow. They were all speaking.'' Toward the end of the selection,one policeman was making the choices, he said.The final group of men were ordered to walk about half a milefrom the field to a dirt road at a spot just outside the garden ofthe house where the killings occurred. They were told to kneel withtheir heads down to the ground, he said. They were kept there abouttwo hours, he said.They were then forced to walk through the wide wooden gate ofthe garden and lie on their stomachs with their hands held behindtheir necks.When the beating with the shovels started, the victims began toscream, he said. Those who turned their faces to the policemen werebeaten much more, he said. ``I was screaming and shouting, but Ididn't turn my face, only once.''The man said that after a while, ``somebody new came to thegarden.''He presumed, he said, that it was the ``new'' policeman who didthe firing. A diplomat who interviewed him on Tuesday said heunderstood from the man's account that one or more policemen didthe shooting.``We were executed one by one,'' he said. ``Some were begging tobe released. Nobody tried to get up.'' The clatter was that of anautomatic weapon, he said.Suddenly silence fell, he said. He could hear the policemenleave the garden and then depart the village with a burst ofmachine-gun fire.A builder by trade, the man said his brother was one of the 13who was shot to death. His brother's body was brought home alongthe same route he had used to escape.The survivor's face crumpled slightly when he was asked if hewould testify at The Hague. He was most afraid, he said, for thesafety of his wife and children, who would most likely becometargets of Serbian revenge.
