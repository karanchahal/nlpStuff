	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Handing the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal only its third conviction, a Bosnian Serb Thursday pleaded
guilty to 14 murders.
	   Goran Jelisic, 30, faces a maximum life prison term for the
killings. Because he pleaded innocent to a genocide charge he will
still face trial at the U.N. court. Only then will he be officially
convicted of the murders, presiding judge Claude Jorda said.
