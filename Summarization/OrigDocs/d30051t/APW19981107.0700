BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia must cooperate with aU.N. war crimes panel investigating allegations of atrocities inthe rebellious Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.S. official saidSaturday.``In the U.N. Security Council, there is unanimous consent ofall its members that investigators ... have full authority to dotheir job in Kosovo,'' said David Scheffer, the State Department'swar crimes envoy at a panel discussion held in Belgrade.President Slobodan Milosevic has defied international pressureto allow prosecutors from the Netherlands-based tribunal to enterKosovo, where hundreds have died in fighting that erupted inFebrurary between separatist ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces.Tribunal investigators have said they want to look into claimson atrocities on both sides.Speaking at the round-table discussion organized by theBelgrade-based nongovernmental Humanitarian Law Center, Scheffersaid there were reasons to believe that ``serious violations ofinternational law'' were committed in Kosovo.Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team ofinvestigators planned a weeklong mission in Kosovo to begin lastWednesday but were refused visas.Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimitedaccess.``Since February this year, between 600 and 1,000 people died inKosovo, many more were wounded,'' Scheffer said.The tribunal maintains it has a legal right to carry outinvestigations throughout Yugoslavia.The wars in the former Yugoslav republics prompted the SecurityCouncil to create the tribunal in 1993 with a mandate to prosecutebreaches of international humanitarian law committed anywhere inthe former Yugoslavia since 1991. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, thelargest of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics.
