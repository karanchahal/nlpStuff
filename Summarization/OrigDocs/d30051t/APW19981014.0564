THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunalinvestigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe ofalleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal officialsaid Wednesday.Visas that were denied earlier by Yugoslav authorities have nowbeen issued, Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt told a pressbriefing. He did not give details on how many investigators willreturn or when.Blewitt declined to speculate on the reason behind Belgrade'schange of heart, nor could he confirm that Yugoslav PresidentSlobodan Milosevic has explicitly agreed to total compliance withthe U.N. court.In a statement, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the UnitedStates, the tribunal's president, welcomed ``in principle'' therecent agreements aimed at averting military intervention. ButMcDonald said she had not yet reviewed them to confirm that theycontained ``explicit provisions and mechanisms'' aimed at ensuringBelgrade's compliance.However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking on NBC's``Today'' program, said cooperation with the tribunal was indeedpart of the agreements with Milosevic.``We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal,''Holbrooke said. ``It is embedded in our agreement that he said hewill fully comply with the U.N. resolution and that calls for(compliance).''Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimestribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely inKosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serbmassacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, was atthe United Nations on Wednesday to clarify the scope and impact ofthe agreements as they relate to war crimes issues.Blewitt said last week that Belgrade officials had suddenlybegun claiming that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to conductinvestigations in Kosovo.The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecutecrimes committed following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,has always maintained that it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovoconflict.Until recently, tribunal staff were allowed to carry outinvestigations in the region, examining reports of atrocities byboth sides in the Kosovo conflict.``Our mandate is quite clear. It is not subject to negotiationsneither by President Milosevic nor Mr. Holbrooke,'' Blewitt saidemphatically.McDonald repeatedly has chastised Belgrade for failing tosurrender indicted war suspects at large in Yugoslavia, inparticular the handover of three men accused of orchestrating thekillings of 260 unarmed people after the fall of Vukovar in 1991.``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to flout the lawand the will of the international community'' by refusing to turnover indicted suspects, she said in her statement.(jc/bk)
