	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison
guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a
milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by
the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.
	   The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial
of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian
government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.
	   On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; Zdravko
Mucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebici
guard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overall
responsibility for the camp.
	   All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, they
face maximum life sentences.
	   Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday's
hearing allowed lawyers to introduce evidence that could help
judges determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.
	   Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present her
case, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitation
to his fragile mental state during the war.
	   An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personality
disorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventually
led to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unable
to exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war or
to make decisions on his own.
	   In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if he
is convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They also
based their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had no
record before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to the
tribunal.
	   Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders of
superiors in the camp, his lawyers said.
	   In a startling development Monday, Landzo even got some support
from fellow war crimes suspect Goran Jelisic, who is awaiting trial
on separate charges. Jelisic, who calls himself the ``Serb Adolf,''
took the stand and praised Landzo for keeping his cell clean,
giving Jelisic some clothes in jail and playing volleyball with
him.
	   ``He's truly a social person, very communicative and a great
joker,'' Jelisic said of Landzo.
	   Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia camp
were ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictment
alleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden and
metal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses that
were then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.
	   The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected to
last only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in part
because the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.
	   Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is part
of the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.
Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were also
scheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.
