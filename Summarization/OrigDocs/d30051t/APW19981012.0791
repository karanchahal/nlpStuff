THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prisonguard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get amilder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened bythe war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday.The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trialof three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosniangovernment-run Celebici prison camp in 1992.On trial are Hazim Delic, Celebici's deputy commander; ZdravkoMucic, the camp's former commander; Esad Landzo, a former Celebiciguard; and Zejnil Delalic, who prosecutors claim had overallresponsibility for the camp.All four defendants have pleaded innocent. If convicted, theyface maximum life sentences.Although the three-judge panel at the Yugoslav war crimestribunal has not yet reached a verdict in the case, Monday'shearing allowed lawyers to introduce evidence that could helpjudges determine prison terms if the defendants are found guilty.Landzo's lawyer, Cynthia McMurrey, was the first to present hercase, using arguments ranging from Landzo's supposed rehabilitationto his fragile mental state during the war.An expert witness testified that Landzo has a personalitydisorder which was compounded by the trauma of war and eventuallyled to diminished mental capacity, meaning he allegedly was unableto exercise his own free will to disobey orders during the war orto make decisions on his own.In written arguments, Landzo's lawyers said his sentence _ if heis convicted _ should not be longer than five years. They alsobased their arguments on his age, 25; the fact that he had norecord before Celebici; and his voluntary surrender to thetribunal.Like all guards at Celebici, Landzo acted under the orders ofsuperiors in the camp, his lawyers said.In a startling development Monday, Landzo even got some supportfrom fellow war crimes suspect Goran Jelisic, who is awaiting trialon separate charges. Jelisic, who calls himself the ``Serb Adolf,''took the stand and praised Landzo for keeping his cell clean,giving Jelisic some clothes in jail and playing volleyball withhim.``He's truly a social person, very communicative and a greatjoker,'' Jelisic said of Landzo.Prosecutors have said that Serbs held at the central Bosnia campwere ``murdered, tortured, raped and beaten.'' A 49-page indictmentalleges that inmates were beaten with steel cables and wooden andmetal bars, burned with heated scissors, wrapped with fuses thatwere then lit, and kept in vats of water. At least 14 died.The Celebici trial, which began in March 1997, was expected tolast only several months but has dragged on for 19 months, in partbecause the U.N. court has five other trials in progress.Taking up sentencing arguments before a trial has ended is partof the tribunal's new efforts to streamline and speed up its work.Lawyers for the other defendants, as well as prosecutors, were alsoscheduled to make sentencing arguments this week.(jc/bk)
