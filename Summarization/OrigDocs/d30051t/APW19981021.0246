	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A delegation of U.N. war crimes
investigators and prosecutors plans to visit Kosovo early next
month, officials at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said
Wednesday.
	   The team, led by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and
her deputy, Graham Blewitt of Australia, will investigate reports
of massacres and other atrocities in the troubled Yugoslav
province.
	   Gavin Ruxton, a senior legal adviser in Arbour's office, would
give no details of the alleged war crimes the team would be
investigating.
	   He confirmed that Arbour would leave for Yugoslavia on Nov. 5,
although he added that Yugoslav officials have not yet granted the
team visas to visit the region.
	   Belgrade authorities recently began refusing to issue visas to
tribunal investigators planning to visit the province, where Serb
forces have been engaged in a seven-month crackdown of secessionist
ethnic Albanian rebels.
