THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the U.N. warcrimes tribunal angrily branded Yugoslavia a ``rogue state''Thursday after Belgrade refused to allow investigators to probealleged atrocities in Kosovo.Authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia confirmed theywould not allow Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav warcrimes tribunal, and a team of investigators to carry outinvestigations in the troubled region.``This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregardfor the norms of the international community,'' said tribunalpresident Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States.``Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds theinternational rule of law in contempt,'' she said.Arbour would not say what her next step would be. She said hervisa request was a matter of courtesy and that she has a legalright to carry out investigations throughout the former Yugoslavia.Arbour had asked for visas for herself and 11 members of herstaff so that they could conduct on-site investigations andinterview witnesses. She vowed to continue investigating ``usingall means available to us,'' but did not elaborate.Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands madehomeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces andsecessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in the southern Yugoslavprovince of Kosovo. U.N. investigators want to check reports ofatrocities on both sides.Kirk McDonald said she would report the non-issuance of visas tothe Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urgeit to take ``forceful'' action to force Belgrade into line.``In the final analysis, it is clear to me that I have anobligation, now that the prosecutor has reported non-compliance, tobring this matter to the Security Council,'' Kirk McDonald said.She said Belgrade's defiance of the tribunal amounted to ``achallenge to the authority of the Security Council'' which hasordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovoand told Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.The visa holdup prompted Kirk McDonald, of Texas, to cancel aplanned visit to Belgrade to speak to a conference on war crimestrials.``This move by the Yugoslav government will have serious legalconsequences,'' said Natasa Kandic, chairwoman of the HumanitarianLaw Center organizing the conference.``With it, the Yugoslav government acted directly contrary tothe U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding free access tointernational investigators to Kosovo,'' she said. ``Relationsbetween the tribunal and authorities here have now become strainedin the extreme.''(mc/bk)
