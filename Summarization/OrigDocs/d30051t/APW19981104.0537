	   SIPITULA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three Serbs were wounded after their
cars were raked by gunfire from separatist ethnic Albanians, police
said Wednesday. The violence highlighted Kosovo's continuing
potential for bloodshed despite last month's peace agreement.
	   Serb police at a checkpoint near Sipitula, about 15 kilometers
(nine miles) west of Pristina, said Albanian guerrillas opened fire
on two vehicles from the nearby Belacevac coal mine Tuesday
evening.
	   They said an ensuing gunfight between police and the attackers
lasted an hour.
	   Three miners in the two cars were injured and taken to Pristina
hospital, according to police. The cars, still sitting at the
checkpoint Wednesday morning, had several bullet holes or marks in
the windshields and chassis.
	   Villagers said Serb police began shooting at the village at
about the same time police said the gunfight began. The villagers
said they fled and spent the night in nearby fields or homes of
friends and relatives.
	   A few who returned Wednesday morning said police routinely
attack the village and force them to flee.
	   In the Netherlands, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal locked horns with the Yugoslav government over the
tribunal's jurisdiction in Kosovo.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said in The Hague that her court
has been given U.N. authority to investigate war crimes in any part
of Yugoslavia. She was responding to assertions by Yugoslav
government officials that Kosovo is off limits to tribunal
investigations.
	   Arbour said Yugoslav authorities still not have issued visas for
a week-long tribune mission to Belgrade and Kosovo, scheduled to
start Friday.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's
population, overwhelmingly favor independence. The Oct. 12
agreement, wrested from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
suspended a nearly eight-month crackdown in the province that left
hundreds dead _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands others homeless.
	   While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they have
grudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise their
goal of independence.
	   Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before the
attack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to be
done to ensure the safety of refugees going back home.
	   Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into the
countryside for the first time in nine years.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.
But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is trying
to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo's
independence from Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
set up a huge police presence.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center _ reflecting views of the Rugova
camp _ reported Serb shelling of Petrovo, 30 kilometers (about 20
miles) southwest of Pristina on Wednesday. The Serbian Media Center
said ``Albanian terrorists'' attacking Serb police were to blame
for the violence at the village.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politicians
from Rugova's party who went missing Oct. 30 in Malisevo, southwest
of Pristina. The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, were
conducting an anti-KLA campaign and ``coaxed people to turn in
their arms,'' said a KLA statement printed in the daily Koha
Ditore.
	   Yugoslavia's state news agency, Tanjug, said two ethnic
Albanians were sentenced to two- and three-year prison terms for
being weapons-carrying KLA members.
