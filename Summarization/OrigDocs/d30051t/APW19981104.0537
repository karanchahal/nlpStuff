The Oct. 12agreement, wrested from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,suspended a nearly eight-month crackdown in the province that lefthundreds dead _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and hundreds ofthousands others homeless.While the guerrillas were not part of the agreement, they havegrudgingly promised to respect it, if it does not compromise theirgoal of independence.Alluding to the police threat to Albanian refugees before theattack, Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader said more needs to bedone to ensure the safety of refugees going back home.Ibrahim Rugova spoke Tuesday after venturing into thecountryside for the first time in nine years.``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begunreturning,'' he said. ``It's a beginning of the process to return.But for a more massive return, more safety is needed.''Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of centralKosovo. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is tryingto persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream of Kosovo'sindependence from Serbia and settle for some form of self-rule.As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government inKosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capitalPristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 andset up a huge police presence.Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along withintimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albaniansfrom returning home in some areas.``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there isstill fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.The Kosovo Information Center _ reflecting views of the Rugovacamp _ reported Serb shelling of Petrovo, 30 kilometers (about 20miles) southwest of Pristina on Wednesday. The Serbian Media Centersaid ``Albanian terrorists'' attacking Serb police were to blamefor the violence at the village.While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demandsto reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown beganlast February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that morespecial police and soldiers must go.On Wednesday, they announced they are holding two politiciansfrom Rugova's party who went missing Oct. 30 in Malisevo, southwestof Pristina. The two, Jakup Kastrati and Cene Desku, wereconducting an anti-KLA campaign and ``coaxed people to turn intheir arms,'' said a KLA statement printed in the daily KohaDitore.Yugoslavia's state news agency, Tanjug, said two ethnicAlbanians were sentenced to two- and three-year prison terms forbeing weapons-carrying KLA members.(pvs/ih/kk/gj)
