For 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across theCaribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting propertydamage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved throughnearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstormover Georgia. It was a disaster _ although not for the entireregion and not necessarily for the tourist industry on which thearea's economy depends.In other words, damage, though extensive, was selective. Indeed,the majority of Caribbean islands were not affected at all by thestorm and its winds, which reached a peak of 135 miles an hour.Georges may have inflicted widespread destruction throughout theGreater Antilles, but ``most of our 32 member states wereuntouched,'' said Jean Holder, secretary general of the CaribbeanTourism Organization. ``So over all, our position, as usual, is agood one, and we want the traveling public to be in no doubt as tothat situation.''The entire Windward Islands group of the Eastern Caribbean, forexample, was bypassed by the storm, meaning that visitors thinkingof traveling to Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, the Grenadines,Martinique, St. Lucia or St. Vincent have no reason to changeplans. Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch islands of Aruba,Bonaire and Curacao and Margarita Island just off Venezuela wereall outside the hurricane zone. The Bahamas, Cayman Islands,Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos Islands also were not affected byGeorges.Even on the larger islands that suffered a direct hit, such asPuerto Rico and Hispaniola, many important tourist destinationswere spared. Though parts of the southeastern Dominican Republicwere severely damaged, for instance, and will not return to fullnormal operations for weeks, all of the hotels, restaurants andattractions in popular northern-coast towns such as Puerto Plataare reported to be functioning normally. So, as always, it isadvisable to check with travel agents, hotel chains and nationaltourist offices about conditions at specific locales andproperties.Though hotels were the section of the tourism infrastructurethat proved most vulnerable to Georges' depredations, as is clearin the country-by-country assessment below, the storm also forcedthe closing of several major airports, including the regional hubin San Juan. But at American Airlines, the principal carrier in theregion, and its affiliate, American Eagle, Caribbean service ispretty much back to normal, said Al Becker, a company spokesman,except for La Romana, in the eastern Dominican Republic. There, hesaid, regular daily jet flights from Miami are not scheduled toresume until December, though prop service from San Juan has beenrestored.According to airline and tourism officials, a few other airportsremained available on a limited basis into October because, forinstance, damage to landing towers, radar equipment or runwaylights prevents after-dark landings. Mayaguez, in Puerto Rico, andSt. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, fell into thatcategory, but have now returned to normal operations. In St. Kitts,where an extensive renovation and expansion of Robert L. BradshawInternational Airport had been completed just weeks before thestorm struck, restrictions are still in force.``That is God's hand,'' Dwyer Astaphan, minister of tourism forSt. Kitts and Nevis, said resignedly early this month. ``Wereceived damage to the tower and also to our terminal, butprocurement is in process right now, and there is no reason why wecannot be completely finished with repairs by Dec. 1.''Cruise lines, on the other hand, say they were virtuallyunaffected. Many vessels were still on summer routes in theMediterranean and Alaska when Georges was ripping through, and willbe returning to the Caribbean only this month. ``The only place wereally ran into problems was Key West,'' said Rich Steck, aspokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, ``and since they reallyhave got their hands full now and are closed to tourism anyway, weare going to be substituting other destinations, such as Nassau,until things are under better control there.''In addition, one pier at the harbor in San Juan, which is secondonly to South Florida as a home port for cruise ships, suffereddamage, according to officials of the Puerto Rican government. Butthat has caused no inconvenience because ``we have enough otherdocks to receive cruises'' at the main harbor, said Jorge Davila,executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. The damage atPort Zante in St. Kitts, opened in 1997, was somewhat more serious,officials there said, but not enough to require cancellation ofcruises.``The first cruise ship to come in was on Oct. 8, a NorwegianCruise Line Vessel with a capacity of 1,534 passengers,'' Astaphansaid. Those returning vessels are tying up not at Port Zante but atold piers nearby. ``I am advised they will be replaced within threeto five months,'' he said. ``In the interim, vessels with up to1,600 passengers can tie up at the old pier, which is where theytied up previously.''On islands that bore the brunt of the storm, beaches, tropicalforests, golf courses and nature reserves were also damaged. Soeven though hotels in the affected areas may be functioning again,the landscape may not appear as lush as it normally does, and somevisitors may therefore wish to postpone trips. On the other hand,tourism authorities on several islands say they may institutecut-rate packages this winter to lure back reluctant travelers.In addition, damage to fields and crops on several islands meansthat some food items may be unavailable at hotels or considerablymore expensive. In the end, then, whether or not to go to theCaribbean during the coming high season is largely a matter ofindividual preference. A survey of the most affected islandsfollows, adhering to the same northwesterly course as thehurricane:(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)nnANTIGUA AND BARBUDA _ Most of the destruction in this nationinvolved residences: Officials estimate that more than half of allhomes suffered some damage. But at least half of Antigua's 28 mainhotels were also affected. Most are back in business, but theCaribbean Hotel Association reports that several do not plan toreopen until December. Among them are the Pineapple Beach Club, theInn at English Harbor, Coco Point Lodge, the Galleon Beach Club andthe Hawksbill Beach Resort.ST. KITTS and NEVIS _ Both of the islands that make up thesmallest country in the Caribbean were struck with considerableforce, which damaged residences and government buildings. ``Everyarea was impacted, some more than others,'' Astaphan said.Government officials estimate that 85 percent of homes sufferedsome damage, most of it to roofs, and put preliminary estimates ofrepairs at nearly $500 million. On Nevis, the smaller of the pair,many of the elegant plantation homes that attract upscale visitorshave recovered quickly. But the island's main resort, the FourSeasons, is not expected to reopen until Dec. 15, due in part tobeach erosion. Nearly half the buildings at the Hurricane CoveBungalows are said to have been leveled, but the hotel remainsopen.Both the Fort Thomas Hotel and Jack Tar Village Resort andCasino on St. Kitts are closed. Officials said the Fort Thomasprobably will not open this season and that the Jack Tar, thebiggest property on the island, is likely to remain closed untilMay.NETHERLANDS ANTILLES _ On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airportremained open throughout the storm, an indication that the islandwas pummeled by less than full-force winds. Almost all of the 19hotels and condominiums are said to have full power, water andtelephone service, although some residential areas were stillwithout electricity early in October, and the Millennium BeachResort and Maho Beach Hotel and Casino are expected to be closed atleast until December.Nearby, tiny St. Eustatius was hard hit by the storm. As aresult, one-sixth of the island's homes lost roofs, residents werestill being advised to boil water as of mid-October, and extensivedamage to natural foliage was reported. Hotels and restaurants,however, are fully operational.UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS _ Early reports of widespreaddamage on all three main islands have proved exaggerated. Suchwell-known destinations as Caneel Bay on St. John, the Buccaneer onSt. Croix and the Ritz-Carlton on St. Thomas briefly stopped takingguests and reservations, but returned to normal after a quickcleanup. Airline service is normal and all attractions are open.PUERTO RICO _ By official tally, more than $2 billion in damageswas inflicted to property across the island. In the San Juan area,several hotels suffered significant damage and, according to theCaribbean Hotel Association, remain closed for repairs, among themthe Condado Plaza, Crowne Plaza, Ramada Hotel Condado and RadissonNormandie. Farther away, the hotels most seriously affectedappeared to be the Hyatt Dorado Beach, which tourism officialsexpect will reopen Nov. 9, and the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, whosetentative reopening date is Dec. 15.The most significant problem in the wake of the storm was thelack of electricity. An extraordinarily high level of preparednessmitigated some of the havoc caused by Georges on other islands, butcould not prevent damage to power lines and generators. Telephoneservice was restored almost immediately; water supplies returnedshortly afterward.``By Oct. 25, we expect that complete electrical service willpretty much be restored in metropolitan San Juan,'' said Davila ofthe Puerto Rico Tourism Company. But, he added, it may take alittle bit longer in the central mountains, where some paradores,or inns, are. The luxury Horned Dorset Primavera Hotel, in Rincon,suffered no structural damage, but was closed until Oct. 8 becauseit had no utilities.DOMINICAN REPUBLIC _ The highest human toll, more than 280 deadand at least 100,000 homeless according to official estimates, wasinflicted here, and the country remains in a state of shock andmourning. Also, the government has come under fire for its allegedlack of preparedness, and the population has complained about slowrestoration of public services, electricity in particular.The most severe damage to tourist facilities was concentrated inthe east, around La Romana and Punta Cana. The area's best-knownresort, Casa de Campo, is one of several hotels still closed,though a reopening date of Dec. 20 has been set for ``a limitedinventory'' of the hotel's 300 rooms and 150 villas. The AllegroResort Bavaro and the Viva Dominicus expect to be fully operationalby mid-November, but the Casa del Mar is scheduled to remain closeduntil Dec. 1, and officials say the Allegro Resort CaribbeanVillage Decameron should be able to resume operations by Christmas.HAITI _ The tourist infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere'spoorest nation is so ramshackle even under ordinary circumstancesthat it has been hard to detect Georges' impact. Hotels inPort-au-Prince, the capital, were suffering frequent power failuresand breakdowns in telephone service in mid-October, a normal stateof affairs there. Georges appears to have done its most severedamage in the Artibonite Valley, far off the tourist track. RoyalCaribbean canceled at least one cruise to Labadie, on the northcoast, but that was because of reports of civil unrest, nothurricane damage, said Steck, of Royal Caribbean.CUBA _ It is off-limits to American tourists, but still drawsmore than one million visitors a year from other countries.According to reports from Havana, hotels there were affected onlymarginally. Some hotels in northern coastal resorts such as CayoCoco, however, reported to have suffered some damage, but have nowreopened.&QL;
