SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It plowed over and past 17Caribbean islands, crashing into the lives of more than 30 millionpeople.As each island fell prey to Hurricane Georges' battering winds,the casualties mounted.They are mounting still. And as they do, island nations arecoming to grips with lost harvests, wrecked government buildings,lost tourist income and sudden populations of newly homeless.Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands. Repairs wereoften quick.Georges was different. It swept past island after island in thenorthern Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in destruction andkilling at least 400 people.In some nations, like tiny St. Kitts, Georges ruined the crucialwinter tourism season and sugar crop on which the islanders staketheir lives.In the Dominican Republic, the immediate concern is survival.More than a week after Georges' 110 mph (177 kph) winds hit,searchers were still looking for survivors in towns swamped byflooding, or combing through deep muck in the grim task of findingthe dead.The numbers of homeless are staggering: More than 100,000 in theDominican Republic, 18,000 and counting in Haiti, at least 17,000in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and 3,000 in St. Kitts _ atenth of that island's population.Along with shelter, the refugees need food, water, ice, clothing_ needs that have overwhelmed the region's small economies andtaxed the disaster response capabilities of the United States,France and other donor nations.Damage to popular hotels like Puerto Rico's bluff-top ElConquistador Resort, and splintered windows in oceanfrontcondominiums, underscore a physical and economic vulnerability thatthe Caribbean's people know but would rather forget.There was a surprise bright spot: The U.S. Virgin Islands _battered by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and 1995's Marilyn, whichdestroyed 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas _ emergedrelatively unscathed despite being in Georges' path.``It's a miracle,'' crowed Elizabeth Armstrong, general managerof the Buccaneer Hotel on St. Croix.Still, Armstrong worries tourists will be scared away from theVirgin Islands by Georges' rampage elsewhere. ``It was such a bigstorm that I'm afraid people will believe the whole Caribbean wasdamaged,'' Armstrong said.Much of it was. Airline service and shipping were disrupted.Entire islands plunged into darkness _ including Puerto Rico andits 4 million people _ and thousands of businesses closed.The storm's economic cost has yet to be calculated. In PuertoRico alone, property damage has surpassed dlrs 2 billion.Without power, food spoiled in refrigerators, and fights brokeout in hours-long ice lines. Beneath a canopy of suddenly brightstars over San Juan, candles flickered in windows and driversnegotiated streets made unfamiliar by fallen trees and theenveloping dark.Given the Caribbean's dependence on tourism _ it earns dlrs 14billion a year and employs half a million people _ promoters areemphasizing the rapid rebuilding in such places as Puerto Rico andAntigua. And they note that in the Windward Islands in thesoutheastern Caribbean and in Jamaica, it is business as usual.In San Juan, giant white cruise ships, their lights blazingacross San Juan Bay, have resumed their weekly visits. Spectacularpink and purple sunsets have returned, a dramatic backdrop to thecommitted navy of surfers and boogie boarders riding the waves offCondado beach. Old San Juan's blue cobblestone streets are bustlingagain with strollers and shoppers.Still, Antigua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico andSt. Kitts could lose tourism in coming months, said Michael Spinksof the Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organization.Last year, more than 1.7 million non-cruise tourists visited theDominican Republic, and Cuba and Puerto Rico welcomed more than 1.1million each. St. Kitts and Nevis earned more than dlrs 25 millionfrom tourists.&UR; MORE
