	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ It plowed over and past 17
Caribbean islands, crashing into the lives of more than 30 million
people.
	   As each island fell prey to Hurricane Georges' battering winds,
the casualties mounted.
	   They are mounting still. And as they do, island nations are
coming to grips with lost harvests, wrecked government buildings,
lost tourist income and sudden populations of newly homeless.
	   Many past hurricanes damaged only a few islands. Repairs were
often quick.
	   Georges was different. It swept past island after island in the
northern Caribbean, causing billions of dollars in destruction and
killing at least 400 people.
	   In some nations, like tiny St. Kitts, Georges ruined the crucial
winter tourism season and sugar crop on which the islanders stake
their lives.
	   In the Dominican Republic, the immediate concern is survival.
More than a week after Georges' 110 mph (177 kph) winds hit,
searchers were still looking for survivors in towns swamped by
flooding, or combing through deep muck in the grim task of finding
the dead.
	   The numbers of homeless are staggering: More than 100,000 in the
Dominican Republic, 18,000 and counting in Haiti, at least 17,000
in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and 3,000 in St. Kitts _ a
tenth of that island's population.
	   Along with shelter, the refugees need food, water, ice, clothing
_ needs that have overwhelmed the region's small economies and
taxed the disaster response capabilities of the United States,
France and other donor nations.
	   Damage to popular hotels like Puerto Rico's bluff-top El
Conquistador Resort, and splintered windows in oceanfront
condominiums, underscore a physical and economic vulnerability that
the Caribbean's people know but would rather forget.
	   There was a surprise bright spot: The U.S. Virgin Islands _
battered by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and 1995's Marilyn, which
destroyed 80 percent of the homes on St. Thomas _ emerged
relatively unscathed despite being in Georges' path.
	   ``It's a miracle,'' crowed Elizabeth Armstrong, general manager
of the Buccaneer Hotel on St. Croix.
	   Still, Armstrong worries tourists will be scared away from the
Virgin Islands by Georges' rampage elsewhere. ``It was such a big
storm that I'm afraid people will believe the whole Caribbean was
damaged,'' Armstrong said.
	   Much of it was. Airline service and shipping were disrupted.
Entire islands plunged into darkness _ including Puerto Rico and
its 4 million people _ and thousands of businesses closed.
	   The storm's economic cost has yet to be calculated. In Puerto
Rico alone, property damage has surpassed dlrs 2 billion.
	   Without power, food spoiled in refrigerators, and fights broke
out in hours-long ice lines. Beneath a canopy of suddenly bright
stars over San Juan, candles flickered in windows and drivers
negotiated streets made unfamiliar by fallen trees and the
enveloping dark.
	   Given the Caribbean's dependence on tourism _ it earns dlrs 14
billion a year and employs half a million people _ promoters are
emphasizing the rapid rebuilding in such places as Puerto Rico and
Antigua. And they note that in the Windward Islands in the
southeastern Caribbean and in Jamaica, it is business as usual.
	   In San Juan, giant white cruise ships, their lights blazing
across San Juan Bay, have resumed their weekly visits. Spectacular
pink and purple sunsets have returned, a dramatic backdrop to the
committed navy of surfers and boogie boarders riding the waves off
Condado beach. Old San Juan's blue cobblestone streets are bustling
again with strollers and shoppers.
	   Still, Antigua, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and
St. Kitts could lose tourism in coming months, said Michael Spinks
of the Barbados-based Caribbean Tourism Organization.
	   Last year, more than 1.7 million non-cruise tourists visited the
Dominican Republic, and Cuba and Puerto Rico welcomed more than 1.1
million each. St. Kitts and Nevis earned more than dlrs 25 million
from tourists.
