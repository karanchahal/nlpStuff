	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti has only dlrs 23 million to
rebuild roads, bridges and irrigation canals destroyed by Hurricane
Georges, less than half of what is needed for just the hardest-hit
areas, the government says.
	   Even before the storm caused floods and mudslides that killed
221 people, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere,
was a disaster zone. The U.N. Human Development Index ranked the
Caribbean nation No. 159 out of 174 countries in terms of income,
life expectancy and education level.
	   About 700 million gourdes (dlrs 43.8 million) is needed to
rebuild after the Sept. 23 hurricane, Finance and Economics
Minister Fred Joseph said at a news conference Friday. He said that
would cover only the worst-hit areas.
	   The United States has pledged 210 million gourdes (dlrs 13.1
million) and the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank
132 million gourdes (dlrs 8.3 million) in emergency aid for
infrastructure. Haiti's cash-strapped government _ embroiled in a
political power struggle for 1 1/2 years that has stalled millions
of dollars in foreign aid _ can contribute only 25 million gourdes
(dlrs 1.6 million), Joseph said.
	   The U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 and Taiwan
dlrs 300,000. Canada, Germany, Japan, and Spain donated additional
hundreds of thousands of dollars. France, Haiti's former colonizer,
sent specialists to help purify water and treat the injured.
	   In addition, dozens of tons of material have been flown in from
private international sources to help hurricane victims.
	   In his estimate, Joseph did not even mention the cost of
rebuilding thousands of homes ripped apart by the storm and more
than 56,000 head of livestock killed.
	   Most Haitian deaths were blamed on flooding and mudslides in
rural, mountainous areas. A flash flood nearly destroyed the
southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where 102 people died.
For generations, Haitian peasants have cut down trees to make
charcoal, denuding mountains left incapable of absorbing rainfall.
	   In economic terms, the hardest hit was the central Artibonite
Valley, which is Haiti's bread basket. Filled to overflowing by
torrential rainfall, the Lake Peligre hydroelectric dam there
threatened to burst. The floodgates were opened, and a terrestrial
tidal wave covered hundreds of thousands of acres (hectares) of
farmland.
	   Economists predict a sharp rise in the cost of living since rice
and beans, Haiti's staples, will have to be imported in greater
quantities.
	   Earlier this month, Joseph estimated agricultural damage alone
at more than dlrs 300 million.
