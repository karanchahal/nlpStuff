PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti has only dlrs 23 million torebuild roads, bridges and irrigation canals destroyed by HurricaneGeorges, less than half of what is needed for just the hardest-hitareas, the government says.Even before the storm caused floods and mudslides that killed221 people, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere,was a disaster zone. The U.N. Human Development Index ranked theCaribbean nation No. 159 out of 174 countries in terms of income,life expectancy and education level.About 700 million gourdes (dlrs 43.8 million) is needed torebuild after the Sept. 23 hurricane, Finance and EconomicsMinister Fred Joseph said at a news conference Friday. He said thatwould cover only the worst-hit areas.The United States has pledged 210 million gourdes (dlrs 13.1million) and the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank132 million gourdes (dlrs 8.3 million) in emergency aid forinfrastructure. Haiti's cash-strapped government _ embroiled in apolitical power struggle for 1 1/2 years that has stalled millionsof dollars in foreign aid _ can contribute only 25 million gourdes(dlrs 1.6 million), Joseph said.The U.N. Development Program donated dlrs 100,000 and Taiwandlrs 300,000. Canada, Germany, Japan, and Spain donated additionalhundreds of thousands of dollars. France, Haiti's former colonizer,sent specialists to help purify water and treat the injured.In addition, dozens of tons of material have been flown in fromprivate international sources to help hurricane victims.In his estimate, Joseph did not even mention the cost ofrebuilding thousands of homes ripped apart by the storm and morethan 56,000 head of livestock killed.Most Haitian deaths were blamed on flooding and mudslides inrural, mountainous areas. A flash flood nearly destroyed thesoutheastern border town of Fonds Verrettes, where 102 people died.For generations, Haitian peasants have cut down trees to makecharcoal, denuding mountains left incapable of absorbing rainfall.In economic terms, the hardest hit was the central ArtiboniteValley, which is Haiti's bread basket. Filled to overflowing bytorrential rainfall, the Lake Peligre hydroelectric dam therethreatened to burst. The floodgates were opened, and a terrestrialtidal wave covered hundreds of thousands of acres (hectares) offarmland.Economists predict a sharp rise in the cost of living since riceand beans, Haiti's staples, will have to be imported in greaterquantities.Earlier this month, Joseph estimated agricultural damage aloneat more than dlrs 300 million.
