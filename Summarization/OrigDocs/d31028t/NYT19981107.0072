MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ A natural disaster as terrible as HurricaneMitch, which killed more than 10,000 people in Central America inthe past two weeks and left nearly 1 million more homeless, teachesa lot about the way a society does or does not work. Someinstitutions and individuals rise to the occasion; others topplelike palm trees in the wind. But the nations of the region alwaysseem to respond in ways that illuminate their history andcharacter.Nicaragua, for instance, is still grappling with many of thesame problems it could not resolve in the 1980s, when theSandinista National Liberation Front was trying to fend offU.S.-backed Contra rebels in a bloody civil war. In that polarizedpolitical climate, the relief effort here last week was hampered bypetty partisan squabbling; the conservative government and theSandinistas, who are now in opposition, even disagreed over whetherit would be more appropriate to declare a ``national disaster'' ora ``state of emergency.''As people in Posoltega, where more than 1,500 people died inmudslides, waited for help alongside other devastated towns, thetwo camps jockeyed for control of the distribution of food andmedicine _ and the political benefits to come with that.By late in the week, with popular discontent rising, the damagecaused by the partisanship seemed to impress even some politicians.President Arnoldo Aleman said he would cede the supervision ofrelief activities to the Roman Catholic Church, while Gen. JoaquinCuadra, the Sandinista who commands the armed forces, belatedlycalled for national unity.Another recent storm, Hurricane Georges, provided insights thatare at least as striking in September. Faced with the threat of135-mile-per-hour winds, three Caribbean island societies that haveadopted radically different social and political models, eventhough they were all once Spanish colonies, responded inconspicuously different ways.In Puerto Rico, a U.S. possession, the government leaped intoaction as soon as the first hurricane watch was issued. Televisionstations repeatedly broadcast warnings to stay indoors and put uphurricane shutters, provided advice on stockpiling food and waterand showed footage of past storms to remind the island's 3.5million residents of what they might face. As soon as Georgespassed, utility repair crews were out restoring service and federalEmergency Management Agency teams were preparing reports andsending money.Next door in the Dominican Republic, disorganization was thewatchword. Newspapers there have complained that the civil defensechief, Elpidio Baez, failed to issue storm warnings because he didnot want to alarm people. He denies that, but television and radiostations continued to broadcast soap operas and merenguecompetitions until just before the storm struck. Some people whowent to hurricane shelters found them closed and were turned awayby soldiers.There are even reports that officials opened a dam on the vergeof buckling without advising residents living downstream, some ofwhom later drowned. The government denies those accounts, but anofficial of the U.S. Agency for International Development said itwas clear that overall, ``when the thing hit, they were totallyunprepared to respond.''The hurricane then moved on to Cuba, which, true to form for amilitarized totalitarian state, responded as if the storm were anenemy to be vanquished. President Fidel Castro instructed residentsof affected zones to evacuate, an order that was enforced by themilitary and local security watchdogs and may have saved manylives. Afterward, the Communist Party newspaper Granma praisedCubans for their ``revolutionary discipline'' and successful``combat'' against Georges, whose ``destructive force'' amounted to``a kind of invasion.''Throughout the Caribbean basin, though, there is also a commonthread. Just as it seems that hurricanes striking the United Statesinevitably gravitate toward trailer parks, here the poorest arealso the most vulnerable and seem to suffer the most, regardless ofwho governs.``We've lived through earthquakes, a pair of civil wars,volcanic eruptions, tidal waves and now this, all in the last 25years,'' said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez, a peasant who lives north ofhere. ``When is God going to take pity on us?''
