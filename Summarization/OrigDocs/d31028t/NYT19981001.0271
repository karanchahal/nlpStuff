   NATIONAL FORECAST 
 
   Frost will cover patches of the landscape from the western Great
Lakes to the northern Ohio Valley on Friday morning. High pressure
stretching from Manitoba to West Virginia will promote mainly
sunny, but very cool conditions in the Northeast quarter of the
nation, with afternoon temperatures mostly in the 50s and 60s. A
pool of very cold air at 15,000 feet over western New England will
cause clouds and a few showers to develop in the hilly terrain.
Brisk breezes from the northwest will gust over 25 miles an hour in
the Northeast.
 
 
   Drier and cooler air will circulate into the Southeast behind a
stalled front in the Gulf states. A few thundershowers will attend
the front in northern Florida and southern Georgia. High pressure
in the central Gulf of Mexico will direct very warm and humid air
into the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley.
 
 
   As sultry air pushes northward into the Plains, it will be
further lifted by a strong jet stream disturbance over Nebraska and
the result will be widespread clouds and showers. A cold rain will
dampen the lower Missouri Valley with showers developing farther
north. Several strong thunderstorms may form in west-central Texas.
 
 
   A wedge of warm, dry air will cover the Southwest. More chilly,
moist air will sweep into the Northwest behind a strengthening cold
front in the northern Rockies. Showers will fall from the Cascades
to the coast. Gusty winds will accompany showers in the
Bitterroots. The central Rockies should notice increasing clouds as
the front approaches.
 
 
   Focus: Triple Tropical Team 
 
 
   Rainfall at Mobile, Ala., totaled 24.12 inches in last month,
marking the city's wettest September on record. The previous mark
for September rainfall was 15.5 inches, set in 1913. Moreover,
September's total was 18.21 inches above the average for the month.
Such inflated rainfalls along the Gulf Coast in September can only
occur when tropical systems are involved. During September, the
tropical trio of Hurricane Georges, Hurricane Earl and Tropical
Storm Hermine each dumped substantial rains on Mobile, boosting
last month's total to its highest total in 85 years. &QL;
