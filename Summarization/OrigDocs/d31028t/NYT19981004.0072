The voice that haunts Bill Becker is a woman's, filled withfear, who dialed in the dark on Sept. 25 as Hurricane Georgesreached its 100 mph peak over the Florida Keys. She was huddled ina closet, her house shaking, a phone in one ear and a portableradio tuned to WWUS-FM, said Becker, news director of the station.As water ran under his feet and chunks of concrete ripped out ofthe studio roof, Becker chatted with the woman and hundreds ofothers in the area.``We were the only thing connecting these people,'' Becker said.``They were describing the water rising. They were asking, `Howhigh is it going to get?' You could hear the howling of the wind intheir phones.''In an industry dominated by group ownership and satellite-fedformats with disembodied voices, the sound of neighbors holdinghands on the air seems almost old-fashioned.``It was absolutely essential,'' said the Monroe County sheriff,Richard Roth. ``We wound up using that as our main source forsupplying information.''Usually, WWUS, owned by Crain Communications of Chicago, is liveonly between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. with news and a flea market. At 11a.m. the station plugs in an oldies satellite feed from WestwoodOne and CNN newscasts.But shortly after Georges arrived around dawn on Sept. 25, with30,000 people still in the Keys, the station's general manager, BobSoos, opened the phones. Six lines jammed immediately.At 10 a.m. the satellite dish blew away. By noon an inch ofwater had turned the carpets into sponges. Callers reported yachtsfloating in back yards.``You couldn't show people you were scared, though I reallywas,'' Gene Michaels, the operations manager, said.As night fell and the worst of the winds struck Key West, studiolights flickered. Michaels played Don McLean'seight-and-a-half-minute-long ``American Pie,'' giving him time tosuck up water with a shop vacuum. He signed off at 1 a.m. as thehurricane headed for the Gulf Coast.
