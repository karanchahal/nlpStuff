fear, who dialed in the dark on Sept. 25 as Hurricane Georges
reached its 100 mph peak over the Florida Keys. She was huddled in
a closet, her house shaking, a phone in one ear and a portable
radio tuned to WWUS-FM, said Becker, news director of the station.
 
 
   As water ran under his feet and chunks of concrete ripped out of
the studio roof, Becker chatted with the woman and hundreds of
others in the area.
 
 
   ``We were the only thing connecting these people,'' Becker said.
``They were describing the water rising. They were asking, `How
high is it going to get?' You could hear the howling of the wind in
their phones.''
 
 
   In an industry dominated by group ownership and satellite-fed
formats with disembodied voices, the sound of neighbors holding
hands on the air seems almost old-fashioned.
 
 
   ``It was absolutely essential,'' said the Monroe County sheriff,
Richard Roth. ``We wound up using that as our main source for
supplying information.''
 
 
   Usually, WWUS, owned by Crain Communications of Chicago, is live
only between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. with news and a flea market. At 11
a.m. the station plugs in an oldies satellite feed from Westwood
One and CNN newscasts.
 
 
   But shortly after Georges arrived around dawn on Sept. 25, with
30,000 people still in the Keys, the station's general manager, Bob
Soos, opened the phones. Six lines jammed immediately.
 
 
   At 10 a.m. the satellite dish blew away. By noon an inch of
water had turned the carpets into sponges. Callers reported yachts
floating in back yards.
 
 
   ``You couldn't show people you were scared, though I really
was,'' Gene Michaels, the operations manager, said.
 
 
   As night fell and the worst of the winds struck Key West, studio
lights flickered. Michaels played Don McLean's
eight-and-a-half-minute-long ``American Pie,'' giving him time to
suck up water with a shop vacuum. He signed off at 1 a.m. as the
hurricane headed for the Gulf Coast.
