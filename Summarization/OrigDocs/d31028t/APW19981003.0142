Things could have been worse. Georges flirted with catastrophic150 mph (240 kph) winds over the Atlantic, but entered theCaribbean near Guadeloupe in a somewhat diminished state.Still, by the time Georges left Cuba four days and 1,200 miles(1,900 kilometers) later, even the usually stoic National WeatherService was calling Georges ``the hurricane that just won't die.''A high pressure system dubbed the Bermuda High kept Georges onits destructive east-to-west track, said meteorologist Jim Lushineat the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.So instead of striking an island or two and then spinningnorthward out of the region as hurricanes generally do, Georges hitagain and again.It smashed public housing in Antigua, swamped the beaches ofGuadeloupe and splintered the glass walls of St. Kitts' new airportterminal.``Hurricane mash up my life,'' Verna McHenry said through tearswhile she picked through the soiled, sodden remains of her home onAntigua.In Puerto Rico, where three people were killed, the squattercommunity of Diamond Point kept its dazzling hilltop view of thesea but little else. Georges smashed its dozens of squatter homes.In its wake, strangers and neighbors banded together to cleardebris, stand in tedious lines for ice, water, propane andbatteries and carry food to the needy.Crossing the Mona Passage, Georges bore down on Hispaniola, animpoverished island of 15 million shared by Haiti and the DominicanRepublic. Its substandard housing proved no match for 110 mph (177kph) winds, and emergency officials seemed unprepared for thedisaster.Fed by up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, rivers swelledinto mile-wide (1 1/2-kilometer-wide) torrents that swampedvillages, entombed dozens of people under tons of mud in aDominican shelter and left thousands stranded for days. Helicoptershad to drop food rations to survivors.In Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, officials opened someshelters only after Georges was pelting the city with sheets ofrain and dangerous flying debris.``They were overconfident,'' said Hugh Parmer, head of disasterrelief for the U.S. Agency for International Development. ``Whenthe thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond.''The United States shipped more than dlrs 500,000 of supplies,including plastic sheeting to roof thousands of homes. U.S.helicopters are helping deliver supplies to victims.Authorities also seemed unprepared in Haiti, where heavy rainflooded the Artibonite Valley, the country's breadbasket.``We're trying to save what we can,'' said farmer Jean RobertoJean-Baptiste, working in a flooded rice paddy.Georges left Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation,utterly dependent on foreign aid to help storm victims. TheDominican Republic, considered one of the region's up-and-comingeconomic and political players, suffered a blow to its development.Fidel Castro seemed relieved in Cuba, where only five peoplewere killed after evacuations to safe zones. ``The first victorywas to reduce the losses,'' Castro proclaimed.The same can't be said for the Dominican Republic.Asked how many people died in his country, the Dominican healthundersecretary, Victor Terrero, replied: ``I'll confess somethingto you. I have no idea.''
