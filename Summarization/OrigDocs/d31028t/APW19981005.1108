PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Searchers recovered more bodiesover the weekend from tons of gravel deposited by storm flooding ina southeastern Haitian town, pushing the national death toll fromHurricane Georges past 150, officials said Monday.Seventeen bodies were recovered in Fonds Verrettes, a mountaintown 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince, bringing thetown's death toll to 102, said Rep. Francois Sanozier, whorepresents the area.Earlier, officials said at least 85 people were killed in FondsVerrettes, population 27,000. The nationwide death toll of at least150 people was released before the 17 new victims of the Sept. 23floods were recovered.In all, Georges killed at least 430 people throughout theCaribbean.Forty years ago, Fonds Verrettes flourished at the foot ofwooded mountains, but farm incomes fell and impoverished peasantscut down trees to make charcoal. With no forest cover to absorbGeorges' torrential rains, storm runoff crashed through the town,destroying dozens of homes and buildings.``We asked the government to build drainage canals. But nothingwas done. Now it is too late,'' said Fonds Verrettes Mayor NelsonFrankel.An Interior Ministry spokesman, Phares Pierre, told RadioHaiti-Inter on Monday that the central government had decided torelocate the town out of harm's way, but gave no further details.A government delegation brought rice, sugar, beans and water forhurricane victims on Saturday, and more aid was expected this week.
