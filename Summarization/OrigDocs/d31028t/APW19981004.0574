SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ At a shelter in Puerto Rico lastweek, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of a dlrs 39 million dollar U.S.grant to rebuild hurricane-ravaged homes.But two weeks after Hurricane Georges pummeled this U.S.territory, thousands still languish in schools, community centersand the homes of family and friends _ and her pledge looks like adrop in the bucket.The cost of getting the homeless into homes will be far greaterthan virtually anyone had imagined, probably well beyond dlrs 1billion. And U.S. taxpayers are sure to foot most of the bill.Officials originally estimated overall property damage to theisland _ including roads, public buildings, parks, beaches _ atdlrs 2 billion, a figure now believed to be underestimated.So far, the effort to solve the homeless crisis has beenaccompanied by confusion. Officials still don't know how manyhomeless there are _ or how to give them homes.Aside from killing three people on the island, Georges destroyednearly 30,000 houses and damaged at least another 60,000, the localHousing Department estimates. Those left homeless can receive up todlrs 25,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as wellas dlrs 13,500 to buy new appliances and furniture.Puerto Rico authorities now say the FEMA program, which wouldallow residents to rebuild their wood and zinc homes, may beill-advised because it will leave new homes as vulnerable tohurricanes as the old ones.Gov. Pedro Rosello instead wants federal block grants that,combined with money from Puerto Rico's local budget, wouldsubsidize more expensive cement homes located out of harm's way.Under his plan, hurricane victims would purchase houses worthdlrs 65,000 for dlrs 15,000, with mortgage payments of about dlrs100 per month.``Even though this has been a disaster for Puerto Rico, weshould look at this as an opportunity to build something betterthan what we had before,'' explained Puerto Rico's HousingSecretary, Ana Carmen Alemany.The plan was presented to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo when hearrived in Puerto Rico last week with Mrs. Clinton.``We are banking on having Secretary Cuomo going back toPresident Clinton and (FEMA director) James Lee Witt and expressingto them support for this program,'' Alemany said.In the meantime, 15,000 Puerto Rican hurricane victims remainholed up in shelters. More are staying with friends and relatives,though no one knows exactly how many.Concrete decisions on solving their longterm plight have taken aback seat to the immediate need to restore water and electricityand provide temporary shelter.``As of now, there is no program yet,'' admitted BessieFigueroa, the Puerto Rico Housing Department's liaison to FEMA.San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said most of Georges' homelessrepresent ``the other face of Puerto Rico'': unwed mothers, welfarerecipients, the unemployed, those in homes most vulnerable todisaster.``These are people who are still waiting to participate in thedevelopment we've had over the past 50 years,'' she said.
