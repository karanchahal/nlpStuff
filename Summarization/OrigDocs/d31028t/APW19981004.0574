	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ At a shelter in Puerto Rico last
week, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of a dlrs 39 million dollar U.S.
grant to rebuild hurricane-ravaged homes.
	   But two weeks after Hurricane Georges pummeled this U.S.
territory, thousands still languish in schools, community centers
and the homes of family and friends _ and her pledge looks like a
drop in the bucket.
	   The cost of getting the homeless into homes will be far greater
than virtually anyone had imagined, probably well beyond dlrs 1
billion. And U.S. taxpayers are sure to foot most of the bill.
	   Officials originally estimated overall property damage to the
island _ including roads, public buildings, parks, beaches _ at
dlrs 2 billion, a figure now believed to be underestimated.
	   So far, the effort to solve the homeless crisis has been
accompanied by confusion. Officials still don't know how many
homeless there are _ or how to give them homes.
	   Aside from killing three people on the island, Georges destroyed
nearly 30,000 houses and damaged at least another 60,000, the local
Housing Department estimates. Those left homeless can receive up to
dlrs 25,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well
as dlrs 13,500 to buy new appliances and furniture.
	   Puerto Rico authorities now say the FEMA program, which would
allow residents to rebuild their wood and zinc homes, may be
ill-advised because it will leave new homes as vulnerable to
hurricanes as the old ones.
	   Gov. Pedro Rosello instead wants federal block grants that,
combined with money from Puerto Rico's local budget, would
subsidize more expensive cement homes located out of harm's way.
	   Under his plan, hurricane victims would purchase houses worth
dlrs 65,000 for dlrs 15,000, with mortgage payments of about dlrs
100 per month.
	   ``Even though this has been a disaster for Puerto Rico, we
should look at this as an opportunity to build something better
than what we had before,'' explained Puerto Rico's Housing
Secretary, Ana Carmen Alemany.
	   The plan was presented to Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo when he
arrived in Puerto Rico last week with Mrs. Clinton.
	   ``We are banking on having Secretary Cuomo going back to
President Clinton and (FEMA director) James Lee Witt and expressing
to them support for this program,'' Alemany said.
	   In the meantime, 15,000 Puerto Rican hurricane victims remain
holed up in shelters. More are staying with friends and relatives,
though no one knows exactly how many.
	   Concrete decisions on solving their longterm plight have taken a
back seat to the immediate need to restore water and electricity
and provide temporary shelter.
	   ``As of now, there is no program yet,'' admitted Bessie
Figueroa, the Puerto Rico Housing Department's liaison to FEMA.
	   San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon said most of Georges' homeless
represent ``the other face of Puerto Rico'': unwed mothers, welfare
recipients, the unemployed, those in homes most vulnerable to
disaster.
	   ``These are people who are still waiting to participate in the
development we've had over the past 50 years,'' she said.
