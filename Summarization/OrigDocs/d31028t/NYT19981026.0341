SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ In many ways, the capital of Puerto Ricodoes not look strikingly different from cities in the 50 stateslike Miami, Houston and parts of New York. There are plenty ofmodern new office buildings, condominiums and fast-food places.And, just as in those other cities, Puerto Rico has lots of modestneighborhoods, away from the modern facades, with people who arejust getting by.But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month andcaused several billion dollars in damages, has brought out one bigdifference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured,insurance executives and government officials estimate that only 30percent or 40 percent of those here are covered.The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges inPuerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies. Instead,it will be borne mostly by the people of the island and the FederalEmergency Management Agency in Washington, using tax dollarscollected everywhere but here, because under Puerto Rico's specialcommonwealth status, its people do not pay Federal taxes.``There's a different kind of insurance here,'' said LemuelToledo, a broker and consultant who has been in the insurancebusiness for nearly 30 years. ``It's called Federal aid.''While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what thefederal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in theGulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in PuertoRico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.``Unfortunately, every time a storm hits an area that isuninsured, or underinsured, taxpayers have to come in and foot muchof the bill,'' said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the InsuranceInformation Institute, an industry group in New York.And something else is increasing federal costs from hurricanesboth here and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Insurers, reelingfrom heavy losses from previous hurricanes, have raised theirdeductibles to 2 percent of the amount of coverage, up from the oldstandards of $250 or $500. For a $100,000 policy the deductible isnow $2,000. One condo complex on the beach here with $25 million incoverage has a deductible of $500,000.The Federal Emergency Management Agency says that people withbig deductibles who need emergency repairs to live in their homescan get government help, and that many homeowners and condoassociations may be eligible for federally subsidized loans.The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance ontheir homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter ofmoney. While there are plenty of expensive houses and limousines onthe island, most people have little money. Annual income averages$8,500, less than half the average in Mississippi, the pooreststate. But in Mississippi, the majority of homeowners has mortgagesand is required by banks to buy insurance. Here, people often buildmodest homes without mortgages _ sometimes worth less than $20,000,and they frequently go without insurance. Moreover, when peoplehere buy insurance they most often buy bare-bones policies that donot cover furniture or theft.But other reasons also account for the difference. Not only domost poorer Puerto Ricans count on federal aid to bail them out ofdisasters, they are also victims, consumer advocates say, ofinsurers here who essentially ignore lower-income homeowners toconcentrate on wealthier clients whose homes are sturdier and whobuy policies with higher premiums.That practice, they say, is a form of discrimination oftenreferred to as redlining, a term that grew out of the practice _now outlawed _ by insurance companies and banks in places likePhiladelphia, Detroit and New York of drawing red lines on mapsaround neighborhoods they decided to exclude.Indeed, in the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Juan,people say insurance salesmen never come calling. Residents saythey do not really understand insurance and they assume they cannotafford it.In the town of Toa Baja, Tanya Davila sat in a kitchen chair inthe shade of her concrete-and-wood three-bedroom house, waiting fora representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Hurricane Georges ripped off most of her house's tin roofing andmost of her belongings were ruined. The house, Ms. Davila said, isworth about $50,000.``It never occurred to me to buy insurance,'' she said. ``Nobodyever came to talk to us about insurance.''Ms. Davila, 42, said she did not know anyone who had homeowner'sinsurance.``People don't buy disaster insurance because they know thegovernment is going to take care of them,'' she said. ```If I canget something for free, why pay for it?' That's not my opinion. Butthat's the way a lot of people think.''In a section of neatly kept homes in the nearby town of Catano,Petra Gonzalez, 78, said she was hoping that FEMA would repair theroof on her $25,000 wood-and-tin house.``I didn't build this house thinking the government would takecare of me if something happened,'' she said. ``I never imaginedanything like this could happen. That's the truth. I'm a poorperson. I'm an elderly person. My husband is gone. If thegovernment doesn't help me, there's nothing I can do.''Some insurers and brokers acknowledged that it was difficult, ifnot impossible, to get insurance on the many inexpensive woodenhouses in Puerto Rico. Nor do insurers regard poor sections asprime markets.``You'd rather deal with the upper- middle-class guy with a$250,000 home and four cars than the guy with a $30,000 home andone car,'' said Toledo, who now concentrates on commercialinsurance. ``It takes the same amount of time, but there is so muchmore premium and so much more commission.''This is not redlining, Toledo contended. ``Redlining meanssomebody asks for insurance and you don't sell it,'' he said. ``Butif nobody asks, you're not redlining.''Juan Antonio Garcia, the insurance commissioner of Puerto Rico,also sees no discrimination. ``This is a free-competition market,''Garcia said. ``The companies are at liberty to write whatever risksthey want to write. People either buy it or they don't. I can'tforce them.''In the United States, J. Robert Hunter, the director ofinsurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said insurers hadnever publicly acknowledged redlining. Yet several big companieshave paid millions to settle suits accusing them of redlining andagreed to open offices in places where there had been no insurancesales force for decades.``What's going on in Puerto Rico has all the characteristics ofred-lining,'' said Hunter, who has made several trips here to workas an adviser to the Puerto Rican government.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)Jose J. Villamil, a Wharton-educated economist who heads aconsulting company, Estudios Tecnicos, which works with thegovernment and private industry, said he did not believe thatinsurers were deliberately discriminating against the poor. ButVillamil said some of the remedies imposed in redlining lawsuitsshould be applied in Puerto Rico anyway.``The government has a role to play in terms of putting pressureon the companies,'' he said. ``The companies should be morepro-active in educating people about insurance and in providingaccess to insurance. Maybe they should develop products more inline with people's capacity to buy insurance.''About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance onthe island. Royal Group, a British insurer with more than 100 yearsof experience in the Caribbean, is among the leaders. Only two bigUnited States companies, Nationwide Insurance Enterprise andAmerican International Group, sell homeowners' coverage in PuertoRico, though Allstate Corp. is preparing to start selling here.The difficulty of handicapping the risks on an island that liesin the path of hurricanes and in an earthquake zone, combined withthe relatively small size of the Puerto Rico market at 3.8 millionpeople, have kept the other big American players away, saidGoldstein of the industry group.``If insurers felt they could add to their bottom line,'' hesaid, ``they'd be in there.''The insurance companies began imposing higher deductibles afterHurricane Andrew walloped southern Florida with $15.5 billion ininsured losses in 1992. To get regulatory approval for the change,insurers in the United States threatened to cut back on the numberof policies they wrote. In Puerto Rico, the insurers said thatwithout the 2 percent deductible, the cost of reinsurance wouldforce them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many.Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the highdeductibles ``may have been a necessary stopgap'' immediately afterHurricane Andrew. But the insurance companies could reduce thedeductible now without harm to their profit margins, he saidadding, ``Reinsurance prices have come way down in the last two orthree years.''In any case, Hunter said, consumers should be given the choice,as they are in some states, of accepting either the high deductibleor paying higher premiums.Jose de la Cruz Skerrett, a plaintiff's lawyer who has oftenopposed insurance companies in court, estimates that with the 2percent deductible, 80 percent of the losses from Hurricane Georgesin Puerto Rico will turn out to be uninsured.For some condo owners, the high deductible means significantcosts. At the 13-story Solemar condominium on the beach in SanJuan, Ivan Tort, president of the board, estimates damages at$60,000 _ well below the $100,000 deductible on the condo's $5million policy. So all the repairs are going to have to be paid byowners of the condo's 30 apartments.``If you live on an island,'' Tort said, ``it comes with theturf.''At the 403-apartment Condado del Mar condominium nearby, Luisdel Valle is not so sanguine. Del Valle estimates damage at $1.5million. But he says much of the building was unharmed and that thedeductible _ now figured at $500,000 _ should not be based on thetotal value of the complex but only on the affected areas.``We don't think this is fair,'' del Valle said. ``Yes, we havea contract, but we believe there are some ambiguities. We're goingto court. We're talking about a lot of money here.'' &QL;
