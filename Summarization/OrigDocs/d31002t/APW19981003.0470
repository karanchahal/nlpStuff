MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Declaring him a martyr of thefaith, Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored Croatia's World War IIcardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but long a symbol of divisionsin the Balkans.Half a million od people watched with delight and gratitude asJohn Paul beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him tothe last step before possible sainthood, in Marija Bistrica,Croatia's leading Marian shrine to the Virgin Mary.John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war andethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one'smemory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''The pope said Stepinac ``having endured in his own body and hisown spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrustedto the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge ofmartyrdom.''Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance tocommunism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from theVatican. But his beatification, the last step before possiblesainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse himof sympathizing with the Nazis.While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supportedCroatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictatorAnte Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime'sgenocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands ofSerbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following hisconviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis. Stepinac'sown notes and recent studies say he spoke out against theatrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still considerhim a war criminal.The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Nazi-hunting group,also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pendingfurther study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jewsdefended Stepinac.John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killingof innocents. He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the wholetragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the courseof this century marked by the three great evils of fascism,national socialism and communism.''``He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, likehim, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucibleof suffering,'' said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a5-meter (15-foot) high portrait of Stepinac.A silver box, containing a relict of the new church blessed _ afinger _ was placed under the portrait.The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland,stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regimeafter the war, saying the last 15 years of his life ``were acontinual succession of trials.''Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in theBalkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.Stipe Dorotic, a 38-year electrician from eastern Croatia, whoattended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification ``willenable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith.''Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, whenit proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first statesto recognize its independence.The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, ledto bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994pilgrimage. He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire topay tribute to those who suffered during the war.He also toured Slovenia in the former Yugoslavia, but has notbeen to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from Orthodoxleaders.(vls/sv/me)
