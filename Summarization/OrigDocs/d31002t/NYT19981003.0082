MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishopof Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the communistsystem,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him on Saturday.Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by payingsuch homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned bythe Tito regime as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped intoone of the most divisive Serbo-Croatian disputes in all theembattled regions of the former Yugoslavia.Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman CatholicCroats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. ToOrthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries buthave largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, thebeatification is a political provocation. They have long viewedStepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regimethat killed tens, even hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews andGypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today'sindependent state.In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewinghistory through a different prism than the peoples he says he wantsto reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-bornJohn Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviettotalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted bythe Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.But in post-communist Croatia, it has been a long time sincereligion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. Asone of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats andMuslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredientof the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded on a steep,damp hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, people expressedpride in the beatification and defiance of its critics. ``It isgood to have a saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,''said Kruno Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who arrived in MarijaBistrica at 2 a.m. to secure a glimpse of the pope. He shrugged offthe complaints of minorities: ``We don't care about their saints.Why should they care about ours?''John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia but has made severaltrips to other regions of the former Yugoslavia, always preachingpeace and unity in an area brutally torn by ethnic and religiousdifferences. In 1994 he made his first visit to Croatia, which ismore than 75 percent Catholic and which lost a third of itsterritory to the Serbs after it broke away from Yugoslavia in a1991 war. Earlier this year, the United Nations returned control ofEastern Slavonia _ the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia _ to theTudjman government. But tensions there remain high.The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as theCatholic Church's complicity in the systematic murder, eviction orforced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under theauthoritarian leadership of Tudjman, moreover, many Croats arerecasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe as patriots and founding fathers ofthe modern Croatian state.The rehabilitation of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heartof this revisionism. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, AntePavelic led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newlyindependent Croatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a ferventanti-communist, initially embraced the Pavelic government as``God's hand at work.''But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews andother minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 hebegan denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested byTito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,imprisoned and released under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XIIlater made him cardinal.The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundredsof Jewish and Serbian lives, but his critics maintain that by notspeaking out more, he condoned and effectively supported theUstashe regime. To Serbs he has long been a symbol of the manyCatholic priests who cooperated with the Ustashe.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)John Paul II, who has canonized more than 270 people andbeatified close to 800, has made more saints than any other pope inhistory. The cause of Stepinac is one of the most controversial todate.A week before he left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Parisasked the Vatican to delay beatification of Stepinac untilhistorians could give the case further study. The interventioninfuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,the Jewish community expressed resignation.``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jewish community in Croatia,which numbers about 2,000. He described the cardinal's record asmixed. ``He tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but henever condemned the regime as such,'' Goldstein said.He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely tothe cardinal's resistance to communism _ was unlikely to promptCroats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will notclarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatiansociety has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt withsuccessfully.''The pope seemed indirectly to address some of the questions thatthe beatification has raised. ``Blessed Alojzije Stepinac did notshed his blood in the strict sense of the word,'' he said, alludingto the fact that martyrs are usually slain by their persecutors.``His death was caused by the long suffering he endured.''He also made a veiled reference to the speed with which theCroatian church leader had been beatified, a process that in manycases can take centuries. ``Very little time separates us from thelife and death of Cardinal Stepinac,'' John Paul said, ``barely 38years. We all know the context of this death: a continualsuccession of trials.''The beatification may also owe its speed to the pope's fear thata successor may be less sensitive to the East European Church'sstruggle against communism, to which he has devoted much of hislife.
