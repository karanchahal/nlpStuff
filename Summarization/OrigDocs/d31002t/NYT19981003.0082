 
   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishop
of Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the communist
system,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him on Saturday.
 
 
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by paying
such homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned by
the Tito regime as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also stepped into
one of the most divisive Serbo-Croatian disputes in all the
embattled regions of the former Yugoslavia.
 
 
   Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman Catholic
Croats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. To
Orthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries but
have largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, the
beatification is a political provocation. They have long viewed
Stepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regime
that killed tens, even hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews and
Gypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today's
independent state.
 
 
   In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,
who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewing
history through a different prism than the peoples he says he wants
to reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-born
John Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviet
totalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted by
the Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.
 
 
   But in post-communist Croatia, it has been a long time since
religion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. As
one of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats and
Muslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredient
of the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.
 
 
   Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded on a steep,
damp hill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, people expressed
pride in the beatification and defiance of its critics. ``It is
good to have a saint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,''
said Kruno Cabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who arrived in Marija
Bistrica at 2 a.m. to secure a glimpse of the pope. He shrugged off
the complaints of minorities: ``We don't care about their saints.
Why should they care about ours?''
 
 
   John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia but has made several
trips to other regions of the former Yugoslavia, always preaching
peace and unity in an area brutally torn by ethnic and religious
differences. In 1994 he made his first visit to Croatia, which is
more than 75 percent Catholic and which lost a third of its
territory to the Serbs after it broke away from Yugoslavia in a
1991 war. Earlier this year, the United Nations returned control of
Eastern Slavonia _ the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia _ to the
Tudjman government. But tensions there remain high.
 
 
   The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as the
Catholic Church's complicity in the systematic murder, eviction or
forced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under the
authoritarian leadership of Tudjman, moreover, many Croats are
recasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe as patriots and founding fathers of
the modern Croatian state.
 
 
   The rehabilitation of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heart
of this revisionism. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Ante
Pavelic led a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly
independent Croatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent
anti-communist, initially embraced the Pavelic government as
``God's hand at work.''
 
 
   But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews and
other minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 he
began denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,
in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested by
Tito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,
imprisoned and released under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XII
later made him cardinal.
 
 
   The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundreds
of Jewish and Serbian lives, but his critics maintain that by not
speaking out more, he condoned and effectively supported the
Ustashe regime. To Serbs he has long been a symbol of the many
Catholic priests who cooperated with the Ustashe.
 
 
   John Paul II, who has canonized more than 270 people and
beatified close to 800, has made more saints than any other pope in
history. The cause of Stepinac is one of the most controversial to
date.
 
 
   A week before he left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris
asked the Vatican to delay beatification of Stepinac until
historians could give the case further study. The intervention
infuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,
the Jewish community expressed resignation.
 
   ``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''
said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jewish community in Croatia,
which numbers about 2,000. He described the cardinal's record as
mixed. ``He tried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he
never condemned the regime as such,'' Goldstein said.
 
 
   He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely to
the cardinal's resistance to communism _ was unlikely to prompt
Croats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will not
clarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatian
society has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt with
successfully.''
 
 
   The pope seemed indirectly to address some of the questions that
the beatification has raised. ``Blessed Alojzije Stepinac did not
shed his blood in the strict sense of the word,'' he said, alluding
to the fact that martyrs are usually slain by their persecutors.
``His death was caused by the long suffering he endured.''
 
 
   He also made a veiled reference to the speed with which the
Croatian church leader had been beatified, a process that in many
cases can take centuries. ``Very little time separates us from the
life and death of Cardinal Stepinac,'' John Paul said, ``barely 38
years. We all know the context of this death: a continual
succession of trials.''
 
 
   The beatification may also owe its speed to the pope's fear that
a successor may be less sensitive to the East European Church's
struggle against communism, to which he has devoted much of his
life.
