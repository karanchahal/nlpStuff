MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia _ Hailing the World War II archbishopof Zagreb as a martyr to ``the atrocities of the Communistsystem,'' Pope John Paul II beatified him Saturday.Beatification is the final step before sainthood. But by payingsuch homage to Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was imprisoned bythe Tito government as a Nazi collaborator, the pope also steppedinto one of the most divisive Serbian-Croatian disputes in all offormer Yugoslavia.Stepinac is a national hero to millions of Roman CatholicCroats, and to Croatia's nationalist president, Franjo Tudjman. ToOrthodox Serbs, who formed a minority in Croatia for centuries buthave largely left or been driven from Tudjman's state, thebeatification is a political provocation. They have long viewedStepinac as a wartime sympathizer with the pro-Nazi puppet regimethat killed tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of Serbs, Jews andGypsies _ a regime that many here see as the precursor of today'sindependent state.In his pastoral visit to Croatia, the ailing 78-year-old pope,who has been in office 20 years this month, seems to be viewinghistory through a different prism than the peoples he says he wantsto reconcile. It is perhaps not surprising that the Polish-bornJohn Paul, who used his pulpit to help topple Soviettotalitarianism, would revere a church leader who was persecuted bythe Communists and died under house arrest in 1960.But in post-Communist Croatia, it has been a long time sincereligion was viewed as a bulwark against an atheist oppressor. Asone of the few tangible differences between Serbs, Croats andMuslims, religion has for the last 10 years been a main ingredientof the nationalist hatreds that have fed their war.Among the more than 350,000 believers who crowded onto a steephill in front of the pope's outdoor altar, there was pride in thebeatification and defiance of its critics. ``It is good to have asaint of our own, someone to speak to God for us,'' said KrunoCabraka, 20, a Zagreb student who came north to Marija Bistrica,arriving at 2 a.m. to ensure that he would catch a glimpse of thepope. He shrugged off the complaints of minorities: ``We don't careabout their saints. Why should they care about ours?''Pope John Paul has not visited Orthodox Serbia, but he has madeseveral trips to Balkan sites, always preaching peace and unity inan area torn by ethnic and religious differences. In 1994 he madehis first visit to Croatia, which is more than 75 percent Catholicand which lost a third of its land to the Serbs in 1991.The Orthodox Church is unforgiving of what it sees as theCatholic Church's complicity in the systematic killing, eviction orforced conversion of Serbs during World War II. Under Tudjman,moreover, many Croats are recasting the pro-Nazi Ustashe, who wereled by Ante Pavelic, as patriots and founding fathers of the modernCroatian state.The beatification of Stepinac strikes a raw nerve at the heartof this history. After Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, Pavelicled a pro-Nazi dictatorship that controlled a newly independentCroatia. The archbishop of Zagreb, a fervent anti-Communist,initially embraced the Pavelic government as ``God's hand atwork.''But as evidence mounted of atrocities against Serbs, Jews andother minorities, the archbishop withdrew his support. By 1942 hebegan denouncing Ustashe excesses, once in a letter to Pavelic and,in 1943, in church homilies and letters to priests. Arrested byTito's forces in 1946, the archbishop was given a show trial,jailed and put under house arrest in 1951. Pope Pius XII later madehim a cardinal.The Vatican and many historians credit him with saving hundredsof Jews and Serbs, but his critics maintain that by not speakingout more, he in effect supported the Ustashe regime. To Serbs hehas long been a symbol of Catholic priests' cooperation with theUstashe.A week before the pope left Rome, the Simon Wiesenthal Center inParis asked the Vatican to delay beatification of the cardinaluntil historians could give the case further study. The requestinfuriated Croatian officials as well as the Vatican. In Croatia,Jews expressed resignation.``There is no question he saved hundreds of Jews and others,''said Slavko Goldstein, leader of the Jews in Croatia, who numberabout 2,000. He described the cardinal's record as mixed. ``Hetried to correct some of the worst aspects, but he never condemnedthe regime as such,'' Goldstein said.He expressed regret that the beatification _ linked entirely tothe cardinal's resistance to Communism _ was unlikely to promptCroats to examine a wartime past clouded in myth. ``This will notclarify the period of World War II,'' Goldstein added. ``Croatiansociety has yet to deal with something that Germans have dealt withsuccessfully.''
