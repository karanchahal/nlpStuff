SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a sun-basked seaside packed withpilgrims, Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds leftby war and totalitarian rule, urging a renewal of values inCroatian society.Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outsidethis Adriatic coastal city for John Paul's final Mass of thethree-day trip to Croatia. Scores of fishing and pleasure boatsanchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived fromZagreb.Adding to the numbers were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, whostreamed in when the border crossing was opened Saturday night forthe first time since civil war ended in 1995, state-run Croatiantelevision reported.``Croats are today called to give a new face to their country,above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of theethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and bythe recent violence of war,'' John Paul said.``It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no truefreedom or democracy.''The need for reconciliation and a renewal of values has beenhigh on the pope's agenda during his stay. The breakup ofYugoslavia sparked a civil war in 1991 that left over 10,000 deadand thousands missing before the 1995 Dayton Accords ended thefighting.Split was untouched by the fighting, but Zadar, Sibenik andDubrovnik along the Dalmatian Coast were both heavily damaged.Dubrovnik suffered damage to some of its art and culturaltreasures.The pope mentioned this in his homily. ``The eye of man can nolonger rejoice in them,'' he said of losses to architecturalmasterpieces. ``How can we not feel regret for this?''Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in theBalkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit wasSaturday's beatification of the controversial World War IIcardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as amartyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with theNazis.Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.(vls/gj)
