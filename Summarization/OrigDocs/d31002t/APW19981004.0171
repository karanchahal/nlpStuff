	   SPLIT, Croatia (AP) _ On a sun-basked seaside packed with
pilgrims, Pope John Paul II sought Sunday to heal the wounds left
by war and totalitarian rule, urging a renewal in Croatian society.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics jammed a beach outside
this Adriatic coastal city for John Paul's final Mass of the
three-day trip to Croatia. Scores of fishing and pleasure boats
anchored off shore sounded their sirens when the pope arrived from
Zagreb.
	   Adding to the numbers were Croat pilgrims from Montenegro, who
streamed in when the border crossing was opened Saturday night for
the first time since war ended in 1995, state-run Croatian
television reported.
	   ``Croats are today called to give a new face to their country,
above all by committing themselves to the renewal in society of the
ethical and moral values undermined by past totalitarianism and by
the recent violence of war,'' John Paul said.
	   ``It is an urgent task, for without values there can be no true
freedom or democracy.''
	   Reconciliation and the renewal of values have been high on the
pope's agenda during his stay. The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a
civil war in 1991 that left over 10,000 dead and thousands missing
before the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the fighting.
	   Split was untouched by the fighting, but Zadar, Sibenik and
Dubrovnik along the Dalmatian Coast were both heavily damaged.
Dubrovnik suffered damage to some of its art and cultural
treasures.
	   The pope mentioned this in his homily. ``The eye of man can no
longer rejoice in them,'' he said of losses to architectural
masterpieces. ``How can we not feel regret for this?''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians in Serbia and Muslims in Bosnia.
	   For most Croats, the highlight of the pope's three-day visit was
Saturday's beatification of the controversial World War II
cardinal, Alojzije Stepinac. Roman Catholics hail Stepinac as a
martyr, but many Serbs and Jews accuse him of sympathizing with the
Nazis.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
