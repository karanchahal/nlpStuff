SPLIT, Croatia _ At a seaside mass here Pope John Paul II calledfor reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged theworld to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended notlong ago in Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.``How could we not recall with anxious concern the continuingtragedy taking place in nearby Kosovo?'' the pope asked from a vastpodium built to look like a ship's prow before hundreds ofthousands of believers squeezed along the shore and onto boatsbobbing in the water. ``May understanding, mutual respect,forgiveness and reconciliation at last take the place of violenceand destruction.''He urged the international community to ``not fail to provideits timely help.''The pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and thenationalist government of President Franjo Tudjman. Tudjman'spopularity has waned even among Catholics under his strong-armedleadership and the country's economic and social troubles. Thearchbishop of Zagreb, Monsignor Josip Bozanic, 49, who wasappointed a year ago, has frequently spoken out against corruptionin the government and other failings.The Croatian president took every opportunity to place himselfat the pope's side during the three-day visit. He had a privateaudience on Saturday afternoon in his residential palace in Zagreb,a modernist glass-and-brick house built for Tito in the 1950s.But the pope did not give his host a blank check. At the mass,and later in his farewell remarks at the airport, John Paul IIrather pointedly called on Croats to make ``society and its civilinstitutions more democratic'' in a country that is rarelydescribed as open and free.``After long years of dictatorship and the terrible experiencesof violence which the peoples of this region have undergone,'' thepontiff said at the airport, ``it is now necessary to make everyeffort to construct a democracy based on the moral values inscribedin the very nature of the human being.''For much of the visit, however, the pope's attention was focusedon another, more remote conflict, namely the Catholic Church'sstruggle against Communism during the Cold War, which thePolish-born pope experienced first-hand. The pope arrived inCroatia, a country of 4 million that is more than 75 percentCatholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros,Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after WorldWar II and died under house arrest in 1960.Beatification is the final step before sainthood, and the homagewas highly controversial. Though many historians say that Stepinachelped save the lives of hundreds of Jews and others during thewar, he was tried as a Nazi collaborator by the Communists. He isstill viewed by Orthodox Serbs as the symbol of the CroatianCatholic Church's complicity with the Ustashe, the World War IIfascist regime that killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands ofSerbs, Jews and other minorities.The Tudjman government has sought to rehabilitate the Ustasheregime as the founder of the modern, independent Croatian state.Croatia's centuries-old Serbian minority has mostly left or beendriven out of Tudjman's state.(STORY CAN END HERE.

Earlier this year, the United Nations returnedcontrol of the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia, EasternSlavonia, to the Croatian government. Prosperity has not yetreturned along with the fragile peace.As the pope lamented Croatia's tragic past and uncertainpresent, he also reminded Catholics not to follow the West tooclosely in its search for a better future. At a meeting with theCroatian Bishop's Conference after the Sunday mass, John Paul IIreminded Croatian church leaders to keep followers in line.``Today, in the new democratic climate, it is necessary to givestrong support to the new evangelization, so that the human person,the family and society as a whole will not be harmed and fall intothe trap of consumerism and hedonism'' the pope said.
