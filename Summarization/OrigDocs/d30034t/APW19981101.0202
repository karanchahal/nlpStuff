	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Assailants killed three soldiers and a
civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's
official Antara news agency reported Sunday. A fourth soldier was
missing and believed killed.
	   The military blamed pro-independence activists in the stabbing
deaths Friday night of two soldiers and a civilian in Weberek, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East Timor.
	   Also Friday, masked men shot and killed a soldier in his home in
Leorama, west of Dili, the military said. There were no arrests.
	   The killings came after several months of relative calm in East
Timor's long-running guerrilla war, which broke out in 1975 when
Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony.
	   The head of East Timor's military, Col. Suhartono Suratman, said
two pistols that the victims in Weberek had been carrying were
missing. Another soldier who was with them was believed killed but
his body had not been found, he said.
	   Citing witness reports, Suratman alleged they were killed by
demonstrators who attended a rally organized by the Solidarity
Council of Students and Youths, a group that wants a referendum on
independence.
	   Indonesia has ruled out the demand, offering instead a measure
of autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
and the release of jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   The army sergeant who was killed in Leorama, Josep Florindo
Pereira, had just returned home from a service at a Roman Catholic
church with his wife, Antara said.
	   Witnesses said two men shot him in the shoulder and abdomen
while he and two other congregation members counted donations
collected during the service. A total of 10 assailants had
surrounded the house of the East Timorese native, Antara added.
	   The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian
troops in East Timor was more than 20,000, far in excess of the
number claimed by the Indonesian government.
	   The Indonesian military has said there are 15,000 soldiers in
East Timor, including 5,000 troops engaged in community work such
as health care and engineering.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after intervening
in a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
rule and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and Portugal,
the former colonial master.
