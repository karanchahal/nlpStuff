He said the area wherethe killings were reported was also a site for resettlement ofJavanese under a contentious government program.``I'd like to know the real truth about what happened,'' hesaid.The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that ateam it sent to the area had found ``no confirmation of large-scaleatrocities.''Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, suspendedU.N.-brokered talks with Indonesia in New York on Friday afterreceiving the first reports that civilians had been killed in anarea where guerrillas are active.
