LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a newproposal to settle their dispute over East Timor, and talks betweenthe two sides are at a crucial stage, according to a U.N. envoy.Envoy Jamsheed Marker said late Thursday that the U.N. proposalenvisages broad autonomy for the disputed Southeast Asianterritory.``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters after a dinner withPresident Jorge Sampaio.He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for verywide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colonythat Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal which was``couched in legal terms'' and could provide the foundation for afuture Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he declinedto give further details.Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlementon East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talkswith Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.After the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto,Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to theterritory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control overits defense, economic and foreign policy.Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected thatproposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory todecide its future.
