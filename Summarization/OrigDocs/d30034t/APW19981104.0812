LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Wednesday he wasmaking progress in his efforts to mediate a settlement betweenPortugal and Indonesia on the disputed territory of East Timor,news reports said.``Progress has been made and we'll pursue the (East) Timor issuewith great commitment,'' United Nations mediator Jamsheed Markerwas quoted as saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break thelong-standing deadlock over East Timor, was in Lisbon for threedays of talks with government officials, lawmakers and exiled EastTimorese independence activists.He said he was skeptical about recent reports of an Indonesianarmy offensive against a small band of pro-independence guerillasoperating out of the jungle in East Timor's interior.``From what I know from the talks I've had with the Indonesianauthorities, I think it's quite unlikely they carried out such anaction,'' Marker was quoted as saying by Lusa.East Timorese opponents of Indonesia's rule claimed Sunday thatsome 2,000 Indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched anattack on the rebels. Jakarta denied the claim.Portuguese officials expressed concern about the reports, sayingthey could undermine confidence-building measures.Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in December1975, a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonialadministration. It annexed the territory, 1,200 miles (1,900kilometers) east of Jakarta, a month later.The resignation of authoritarian Indonesian President Suharto inMay and the democratic changes introduced under his successor, B.J.Habibie, have brought fresh impetus to negotiations for a solution.(bh/jt)
