KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 100 people held acandlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday,demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence inEast Timor.They shouted, ``Free East Timor!'' and held banners that read``Stop Military Oppression!'' as a small group of police watchednearby.The peaceful protest in Kuala Lumpur was to commemorate theanniversary of a 1991 massacre of anti-Indonesian protesters.Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independenceprotesters in Dili, the East Timor capital. A government report putthe death toll at 50. Human rights activists say about 200 peoplewere killed.Earlier, a coalition of Asian activists denounced an offer byHabibie to give East Timor some autonomy in exchange forrecognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.``We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine stepsfor a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' said Nadiah Bamadhaj, ofthe Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.The activists also urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperationgroup to address the problem. APEC officials have begun meeting inKuala Lumpur ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit.``There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor,'' said GusMiclat, of the Manila-based Asia-Pacific Coalition for East Timor.``We hope the APEC leaders would address that.''The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailedactivists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. He is serving a20-year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.At the candlelight vigil, Miclat read aloud a message to theprotesters that he said was obtained from Xanana in prison.In the letter, Xanana called Habibie's efforts ``anunprecedented step,'' but said human rights abuses had to stop.``Jakarta must commit itself to ending the activities of itssoldiers, intelligence agents and paramilitary groups that continueto terrorize the population,'' Xanana said.Meanwhile, some 10,000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili,the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the gravesof the dead. They lit candles as police watched from a distance.Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troopsintervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days ofPortuguese rule.
