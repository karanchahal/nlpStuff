 
   UNITED NATIONS _ Opponents of Indonesia's control over the
disputed territory of East Timor said Thursday that documents
leaked from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense show that the army
is not drawing down its forces in the territory as the government
has reported.
 
 
   The documents date from August, and the situation might have
changed since then. Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, has
said several times in recent weeks that Indonesia stood by its
pledge to keep combat forces out of the territory.
 
 
   But the documents show a total of more than 12,000 Indonesian
troops assigned to East Timor, twice the number of soldiers that
Indonesia says are based there.
 
 
   They also show that the Indonesian army, known by its Indonesian
acronym Abri, counts among its numbers the members of pro-Jakarta
local youth groups, militias and public officials with ties to the
army. In the past the Indonesian government has always described
these groups as spontaneous organizations.
 
 
   The military documents put the number of people in these groups
at 9,000, bringing the total military presence to more than 21,000.
 
 
   A series of Indonesian army tables and charts were made
available to The New York Times by the East Timor Action Network, a
group that supports independence for the territory. Human rights
groups say they believe the documents are authentic. The East Timor
Action Network plans to make the documents public on Friday.
 
 
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a year after the former
Portuguese colony was abandoned by Lisbon. The documents cover a
period of nine months that ended in August of this year, when a new
Indonesian government announced that it had withdrawn more than
1,000 combat troops, and said that only about 6,000 defense forces
remained. None of the leaked documents track how figures may have
changed since then.
 
 
   Alatas, the foreign minister, is taking part in discussions with
the Portuguese under U.N. auspices over the future of East Timor,
which Lisbon and Jakarta agree should be given a large measure of
autonomy. The political opening provided by President B.J. Habibie,
who took over after the fall of President Suharto in May, has
resulted in rising tensions in the territory, and with them reports
of new Indonesian military movements.
 
 
   Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia,
said in an interview in New York on Thursday that an increased
atmosphere of openness since May has emboldened independence forces
among the territory's 800,000 people, where calls for a referendum
on the region's future are heard more often.
 
 
   ``The government is saying that it is going to give wide-ranging
autonomy to East Timor,'' Ms. Jones said in New York. ``But at the
same time it is beginning to use the term autonomy as synonymous
with pro-integration, because autonomy means that you accept
Indonesian sovereignty.''
 
 
   ``The resistance and pro-independence forces in East Timor are
not only making themselves much more visible than ever before but
also challenging that concept of autonomy much more openly than
ever before.''
 
 
   ``So what used to be the clash between the pro-integration and
anti-integration forces has become widespread tension as a result
of differences over support for a referendum _ which is clearly the
popular option _ and support for autonomy, which is clearly the
government position,'' Ms. Jones said.
 
 
   In Washington, a State Department official said that the United
States has not been able to confirm reports that more Indonesian
troops are going to East Timor, but that it has also not been able
to verify how many were withdrawn in the summer. ``How you count
people makes a big difference,'' the official said.
 
 
   George Aditjondro, an Indonesian human rights activist who
teaches the sociology of corruption at Newcastle University in
Australia, where he has documented the wealth of the Suharto
family, said on Thursday that he is certain that ``the documents
came from Cilangkap, Indonesia's Pentagon,'' and that they are very
revealing because of how they count people.
 
 
   ``They tell us that the number of soldiers in the field is
nearly twice the number officially mentioned,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Chicago, where he is attending a
conference.
 
 
   ``The second thing is that maybe these are the first documents
that put the paramilitary units, the counterinsurgency units, on
Abri's payroll,'' Aditjondro said. ``The government previously
called them spontaneous youth groups wanting to defend the
integration of East Timor.''
 
 
   He added that the documents show that ``the presence of the
Indonesian state in East Timor is heavily militarized.''
