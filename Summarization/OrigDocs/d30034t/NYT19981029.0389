UNITED NATIONS _ Opponents of Indonesia's control over thedisputed territory of East Timor said Thursday that documentsleaked from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense show that the armyis not drawing down its forces in the territory as the governmenthas reported.The documents date from August, and the situation might havechanged since then. Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, hassaid several times in recent weeks that Indonesia stood by itspledge to keep combat forces out of the territory.But the documents show a total of more than 12,000 Indonesiantroops assigned to East Timor, twice the number of soldiers thatIndonesia says are based there.They also show that the Indonesian army, known by its Indonesianacronym Abri, counts among its numbers the members of pro-Jakartalocal youth groups, militias and public officials with ties to thearmy. In the past the Indonesian government has always describedthese groups as spontaneous organizations.The military documents put the number of people in these groupsat 9,000, bringing the total military presence to more than 21,000.A series of Indonesian army tables and charts were madeavailable to The New York Times by the East Timor Action Network, agroup that supports independence for the territory. Human rightsgroups say they believe the documents are authentic. The East TimorAction Network plans to make the documents public on Friday.Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a year after the formerPortuguese colony was abandoned by Lisbon. The documents cover aperiod of nine months that ended in August of this year, when a newIndonesian government announced that it had withdrawn more than1,000 combat troops, and said that only about 6,000 defense forcesremained. None of the leaked documents track how figures may havechanged since then.Alatas, the foreign minister, is taking part in discussions withthe Portuguese under U.N. auspices over the future of East Timor,which Lisbon and Jakarta agree should be given a large measure ofautonomy. The political opening provided by President B.J. Habibie,who took over after the fall of President Suharto in May, hasresulted in rising tensions in the territory, and with them reportsof new Indonesian military movements.Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia,said in an interview in New York on Thursday that an increasedatmosphere of openness since May has emboldened independence forcesamong the territory's 800,000 people, where calls for a referendumon the region's future are heard more often.``The government is saying that it is going to give wide-rangingautonomy to East Timor,'' Ms. Jones said in New York. ``But at thesame time it is beginning to use the term autonomy as synonymouswith pro-integration, because autonomy means that you acceptIndonesian sovereignty.''``The resistance and pro-independence forces in East Timor arenot only making themselves much more visible than ever before butalso challenging that concept of autonomy much more openly thanever before.''``So what used to be the clash between the pro-integration andanti-integration forces has become widespread tension as a resultof differences over support for a referendum _ which is clearly thepopular option _ and support for autonomy, which is clearly thegovernment position,'' Ms. Jones said.In Washington, a State Department official said that the UnitedStates has not been able to confirm reports that more Indonesiantroops are going to East Timor, but that it has also not been ableto verify how many were withdrawn in the summer. ``How you countpeople makes a big difference,'' the official said.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)George Aditjondro, an Indonesian human rights activist whoteaches the sociology of corruption at Newcastle University inAustralia, where he has documented the wealth of the Suhartofamily, said on Thursday that he is certain that ``the documentscame from Cilangkap, Indonesia's Pentagon,'' and that they are veryrevealing because of how they count people.``They tell us that the number of soldiers in the field isnearly twice the number officially mentioned,'' he said in atelephone interview from Chicago, where he is attending aconference.``The second thing is that maybe these are the first documentsthat put the paramilitary units, the counterinsurgency units, onAbri's payroll,'' Aditjondro said. ``The government previouslycalled them spontaneous youth groups wanting to defend theintegration of East Timor.''He added that the documents show that ``the presence of theIndonesian state in East Timor is heavily militarized.''
