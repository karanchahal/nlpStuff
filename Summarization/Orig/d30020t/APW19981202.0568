	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Star striker Chen Yang scored a hat
trick Wednesday for China in a lackluster 4-1 victory over
Cambodia, securing his country a spot in the second soccer round
for the 13th Asian Games.
	   Underdog Turkmenistan also earned a second-round berth by
overcoming a 2-0 half-time deficit to defeat South Korea in a
nail-biting finish, with two goals coming in the final 10 minutes.
	   The United Arab Emirates and North Korea ended regulation play
and extra time at 3-3, settling their Group E match in the southern
city of Songkhla with a penalty shootout. The Emirates won, 7-4.
	   Playing at the National Stadium on a poor pitch with traces of
day-old repairs visible, host Thailand made a fiery debut against
Hong Kong, shutting out their opponents 5-0 after leading 3-0 at
the half.
	   Thailand's Kritsada Piandit scored the first goal barely a
minute into the match, followed by teammates Worawood Srimaka on a
penalty in the eighth minute and Kiatisuk Senamuang in the 22nd
minute.
	   Eight minutes into the second half, Tawan Sripan kicked in
Thailand's fourth goal, and Kiatisuk hit the target for the second
time at the 40th minute to make the final score 5-0.
	   The result takes Hong Kong out of competition, since they also
lost their Group F opener to Oman on Monday.
	   China fulfilled expectations of topping Group B in Surat Thani
with the victory over Cambodia, the 4-1 scoreline mirroring
Monday's rout of Lebanon. But though the Chinese dominated, they
failed to sparkle.
	   Chen scored early in the first half, heading in a long pass from
midfield. Peng Wang caught a pass on the right side about 10
minutes later and fired his second Asian Games goal.
	   Chen scored again on a near shot and headed in his third goal in
the 38th minute.
	   Cambodia partially salvaged its honor late in the second half
when Hok Sochetra beat the complacent Chinese defense and scored.
It was one of the only shots on goal that the Cambodians had.
	   Following Monday's victory over regional favorite Vietnam,
Turkmenistan staged its second upset in Group A in the central city
of Nakhon Sawan, eclipsing South Korea.
	   The South Koreans carved up the Turkmenistan defense in the
first half. Yong-Soo Choi gave his team _ which hoped to erase
memories of a dismal World Cup _ a commanding two-goal advantage
with an opening-minute goal and a shot that pin-balled off a
teammate into the net in the 44th minute.
	   Turkmenistan regrouped after the half. A long cross found the
head of Igor Kislov to put Turkmenistan on the scoreboard. Steady
pressure led to a dangerous foul and red card for South Korea's
Byoung-Keun Lee.
	   Muslim Agaev took advantage of the reduced South Korean side
with a slicing left-footed shot into the top far corner to
equalize. Kislov fired home the winner in the dying minutes.
