	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Once at the top of world field hockey,
India would like to have a hockey god to help regain that glory.
	   ``Things are changing in Bangkok, and we are feeling much
better,'' Rajinder Singh, manager of the Indian hockey squad, said
Friday, a day after the Indians defeated Japan 3-2 in a warmup
match for the Asian Games.
	   The Indians, who number 980 million, have an amazing quality of
discovering gods who number in hundreds of thousands. There is even
a goddess for small pox and Indians still pray to her to keep that
disease, almost eradicated, away.
	   ``We believe in divine blessings and we hope it pours on us,''
said Singh.
	   There are so many ifs for the Indians on the way to a gold medal
in the 12-nation tournament that it may well be luck besides skill
and endurance needed to reach the top.
	   In its glory days, skill helped India win a total of eight
Olympic gold medals, the most recently in 1980. But the Indians
have won an Asian Games gold medal only once, silver eight times
and bronze once.
	   The South Koreans, who have remained a force in field hockey
since winning the gold in the 1986 Asian Games at home, are clearly
the favorite.
	   Between winning the last Asian Games gold in Hiroshima in 1994,
the Koreans have figured in two World Cups, two Champions Trophy
events and the Atlanta Olympics.
	   The Indians were silver medalists at Hiroshima, but since then
have suffered a downward swing. They placed eighth at the 1996
Olympics and one step lower in the Utrecht World Cup. At this
year's Commonwealth Games, India was out of the medals.
	   In Bangkok, however, there are some silver linings.
	   Skipper Dhanraj Pillay is a passionate player and no defense is
safe against him if he gets the ball properly. Baljit Singh
Dhillon, a specialist in flick-drives in goal-winning penalty
corners, has shaped up well.
	   Pakistan, India's traditional rival in the subcontinent on many
issues besides sports, can also dampen the Indian hope for a
comeback. Pakistan has won the Asian Games gold medal seven times,
silver twice and bronze once.
	   The other medalists at the Asians Games have been Malaysia with
five bronzes and Japan with two.
