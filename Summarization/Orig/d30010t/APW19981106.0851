	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. On Oct. 29, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   The Mahane Yehuda market _ several square blocks of narrow,
stone-walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit,
vegetables and spices _ was packed with shoppers making last-minute
purchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into the
air. Shoppers _ many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirts
or long black frock coats _ fled in panic, some scattering their
purchases on the street.
	   At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reduced
to a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column left
intact. Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by the
force of the blast; a few feet (meters) away was a second body,
bare-legged and face down in a pool of blood.
	   Police said they had determined the identities of the
assailants, but refused to release any details. Witnesses' accounts
suggested the blast had gone off prematurely, perhaps averting a
much larger loss of life.
	   Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from the car and
heard a series of popping explosions before a larger blast shook
the area. By then, people had already started running away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were not that many people
nearby,'' said witness Yaakov Shlomo. ``That was a miracle from
heaven.''
	   Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris; by
nightfall seven people remained hospitalized.
	   Blasted-apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel
radio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intended
to carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago that
killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
	   Israeli officials acknowledged that the toll was remarkably
light for an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said it
still showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.
	   ``We can't depend on miracles _ we need to fight the cycle of
terrorism,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. He and other
Cabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifying
the agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their session
and did not schedule a date for resumption.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said he still expected the accord to be ratified eventually. But
the suspension of debate will almost certainly bring delays in the
tightly timed 12-week schedule for implementation.
	   The Cabinet it would take up the accord again only after
verifying ``that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps
for an all-out war against terrorist organizations.''
	   Palestinian officials denounced the attack and urged Israel not
to let it hold up the accord.
	   ``I hope that at this critical period, we will concentrate on
the bigger picture,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said as he headed into a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. ``The
answer to extremists on both sides sworn to sabotage this process
must be a big `No.'''
	   He also urged the United States to step in and make sure that
Israel will ratify the accord.
	   Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests by
right-wing Israelis broke out. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!''
a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind the police
barricades. Several were arrested.
	   At times like this, Israel has a small-town feel; within moments
of the blast, people all over Jerusalem knew of it.
	   In the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, itself the scene of a suicide
bombing 14 months ago, people in open-air cafes clustered around
radios, listening, nodding and relaying the news. ``Bomb, Mahane
Yehuda,'' they told passersby.
	   Yair Cohen, 45, a bus-company worker who was shopping at the
market, said that moments before the blast he had given money to a
beggar on the street as a ``mitzvah'' _ a good deed that observant
Jews believe will help lead to their own salvation.
	   ``I said to myself, `Maybe this will save my life,''' he
recounted later at the hospital, his gray T-shirt stained with
blood where he was hit by flying shrapnel. ``And ten minutes later,
there was the explosion _ and I really did escape death.''
