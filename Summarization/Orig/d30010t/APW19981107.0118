	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops
to keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord from
becoming reality.
	   In recent days, suicide bombers have attacked an Israeli school
bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Last month,
grenades were hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of
Beersheba.
	   But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major
casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an
indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already
weakened the militants.
	   In Friday's market attack _ which was initially claimed by the
largest militant group, Hamas, but later blamed on activists from
the smaller Islamic Jihad group _ Israel radio quoted police as
describing the explosives as an ``amateur bomb.'' It killed the two
bombers and injured 21 Israelis.
