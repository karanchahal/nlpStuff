	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   However, Palestinian security officials said that it was members
of the militant Islamic Jihad group which carried out the attack.
The officials identified one of the assailants as Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
	   Anata, which is under Israeli control, straddles the line
between the West Bank and Jerusalem.
	   Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said that second assailant came
from the Palestinian controlled areas.
	   In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Friday
evening news program and condemned the bombing as ``criminal.''
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' said
a grim-faced Arafat Arafat, adding that he would ``exert 100
percent effort'' to track down those involved in the attack.
	   Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
his sorrow. The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace
process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly
step up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's
office said.
	   The Palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack following
their meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use it
as an excuse to halt the peace process.
