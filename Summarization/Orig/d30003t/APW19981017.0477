LONDON (AP) _ Eight years after his turbulent regime ended,former Chilean strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet is being called toaccount by Spanish authorities for the deaths, detention andtorture of political opponents.Responding to a Spanish extradition warrant, British policeannounced Saturday they have arrested Pinochet on allegations thathe murdered an unidentified number of Spaniards in Chile betweenSept. 11, 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. Noreason for the dates was given.Chile said it would protest to British authorities, arguing thatthe 82-year-old senator-for-life has diplomatic immunity. ButBritain said Pinochet did not have diplomatic immunity. PrimeMinister Tony Blair's office said it was ``a matter for themagistrates and the police.''Pinochet, whose ruthless regime was widely criticized for itshuman rights record, was recovering from surgery in a London clinicwhen he was held Friday night.No hearing date has been set.Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but hisSantiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinicwhen police came for him. A regular visitor to Britain, Pinochetunderwent surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a spinal disorderwhich has given him pain and hampered his walking in recent months.In a statement issued in Porto, Portugal, where PresidentEduardo Frei is attending the Ibero American summit, the Chileangovernment said it is ``filing a formal protest with the Britishgovernment for what it considers a violation of the diplomaticimmunity which Sen. Pinochet enjoys.''The statement, read by acting foreign minister MarianoFernandez, demanded ``that steps be taken to allow an early end ofthis situation.'' Chile has previously said it does not recognizethe authority of foreign courts over incidents within Chile.Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, also attending the IberoAmerican summit, said his government ``respects the decisions takenby courts.''British law recognizes two types of immunity: state immunity,which covers heads of state and government members on officialvisits, and diplomatic immunity for persons accredited asdiplomats.Jeremy Corbyn, a lawmaker from Britain's governing Labor Party,applauded the arrest. ``It will be the first time this ghastlydictator has faced questions,'' he told Sky television. ``He is oneof the great murderers of this century.''Richard Bunting of the human rights group Amnesty International,which has frequently criticized Pinochet, said the Britishgovernment was ``under obligation to take legal action'' againsthim.It was not immediately clear which clinic was treating Pinochet,who is 83 next week. Staff at the London Bridge Hospital, where hereportedly had surgery, refused comment. He has a pacemaker andhearing aid, but is generally in good health.Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probesinto human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed arequest to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after anotherjudge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.Castellon's probe into murder, torture and disappearances inChile during Pinochet's regime began in 1996. Garzon is alsoinvestigating the disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens inArgentina during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.Pinochet is implicated in Garzon's probe through his involvementin ``Operation Condor,'' in which military regimes in Chile,Argentina and Uruguay coordinated anti-leftist campaignsPinochet, the son of a customs clerk who ousted electedPresident Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup, remainedcommander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, when he wassworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for him in aconstitution drafted by his regime.While in power he also pushed through an amnesty covering crimescommitted before 1978, when most of his human rights abusesallegedly took place. One official report says 3,197 politicalopponents died during his term and 1,102 people remain unaccountedfor after being detained by his security agents.(scl-rb)
