SANTIAGO, Chile _ Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish toforget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen.Augusto Pinochet, the immediate popular response here to thesensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable forits moderation.About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at theresidence of the British ambassador on Saturday evening to protestthe arrest, some throwing fruit and eggs at the building.Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearbyresidence of the Spanish ambassador before the police arrived in atruck with water cannon, at which point the protesters obedientlywithdrew.Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape ofa leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with theprotesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carriedkicking and screaming into a police van.But in a display of uncensored political debate that would havebeen unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's rule,television broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrestfrom political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders torightist retired generals.Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of Pinochet'sdictatorial ways, including the deaths and disappearances of morethan 3,000 people in the 17 years that followed his violentoverthrow of the elected Socialist government of President SalvadorAllende in 1973.But most political analysts say a large majority wants to putthe era of radical politics and repression behind it, a trendequally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which alsowent through periods of rule by military juntas.President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, in Portugal for a summitmeeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders, charged that Britainwas breaking international law, saying that Pinochet, now anunelected senator for life, carried a diplomatic passport givinghim legal immunity.Frei leads a governing coalition that includes ChristianDemocrats and Socialists, and his strong defense of the general'srights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilianpoliticians who have spent most of their political careers opposingPinochet.Only one presidential candidate in next year's electionsexpressed support for the Spanish and British actions, and that wasGladys Marin of the Communist Party. ``I couldn't be more happy,''she told local television. ``This government has been unwilling tobring this genocidal criminal to justice over the last eight years,so it is up to the Spanish to do it.''The leading leftist candidate, Ricardo Lagos of the SocialistParty, was far more cautious. Lagos gently scolded Pinochet for notanticipating his arrest abroad but said he did want to get involvedin a judicial matter. Effectively, Lagos was walking a tight linein order to deflect conservatives' claims that his election wouldreturn Chile to the political and economic turbulence of Allende'sabbreviated rule.The two leading conservative candidates predictably criticizedthe arrest, and some rightist politicians urged the government tobreak relations with London in protest.Supporters of Pinochet pledged to mobilize street demonstrationsdemanding his release, while the Communist Party and human rightsgroups promised marches supporting the British action and apossible Spanish prosecution for alleged crimes against humanity.But Sunday was just another Sunday for most Chileans, who packedSantiago's parks on a splendidly sunny spring day. A few lightlyarmed police officers directed traffic away from the British andSpanish embassies, and flimsy three-feet high wire fences wereplaced around the buildings.Attempting to explain the calm, Mireya Garcia, secretary generalof the Group of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared, said:``After 25 years of absolute impunity for violators of humanrights, it takes a while for the people to absorb this news andunderstand its importance and dimensions.''(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)For all the normalcy, the arrest of Pinochet opened a revealingwindow into a new Chilean society, one run by democraticallyelected civilians side-by-side with a still influential military.President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who for years was portrayed as thedevil incarnate in the Chilean media, was shown on television in avery human light, reacting to the arrest with confused amusement.News clips of Chilean exiles celebrating the arrest receivedprominent play. Their shouts of ``murderer'' and posters of theformer dictator bearing the word ``Wanted'' were broadcast on thesame show that included an interview with Augusto Pinochet Hiriart,Pinochet's son.``Countries have lost wars and committed real genocide,'' hesaid, ``but that is not what happened here.''
