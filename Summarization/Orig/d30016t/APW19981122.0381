	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair ``did everything correctly''
in installing a state-of-the-art entertainment system switched off
last month in the wake of the crash of Flight 111, the airline's
chief executive said in an interview published Sunday.
	   Swissair acted voluntarily to disconnect the video-on-demand
system, connected to a power supply routed through the cockpit,
after Canadian investigators detected signs of heat damage on
wiring and other debris from the ceiling around the cockpit of the
MD-11.
	   ``It's the leading product, customers liked it, and its
installation was correctly certified,'' CEO Jeffrey Katz was quoted
as saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsZeitung. ``As far as we know
now, we did everything correctly.''
	   Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by
Phoenix-based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
	   The plane bound from New York to Geneva crashed Sept. 2 off the
coast of Nova Scotia, killing all 229 people on board. The cause of
the crash has yet to be determined.
