 
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators looking into the crash last month of
Swissair Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia have found ``heat
damage'' in wires from the plane's in-flight entertainment system,
prompting the airline to disconnect the system on all of its jumbo
jets, Swissair officials said Thursday.
 
 
   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said in a statement
that there was not enough information to determine whether the heat
damage was a possible source of the smoke that the pilots reported
in the cockpit shortly before the crash, or whether it was ``merely
the byproduct of other events.''
 
 
   One aviation safety official called it ``a circumstantial
clue.''
 
 
   The entertainment system installed by Swissair is apparently not
used by any other airline, although the Federal Aviation
Administration _ which approved the installation for Swissair _
said that if it found an airline using the same equipment, it would
ask that the system be turned off.
 
 
   The system is installed on the first-class and business-class
seats of Swissair's 15 surviving MD-11s and its three 747s. It
includes a video screen that unfolds from the armrest like a tray
table and can be used by a passenger to watch a variety of movies
or play casino-style games.
 
 
   A spokeswoman for the airline, Jackie Pash, stressed that
investigators had not determined what role, if any, the system
played in the crash. ``People are going to immediately think this
is a cause of 111, and that has not been determined at all,'' she
said. ``Swissair is interested in taking any precautionary
measures, as you can imagine.''
 
 
   About 70 percent of the plane has been recovered, and work is
continuing to find more of it.
 
 
   From the parts that have been recovered, investigators have
found that much of the heat damage is concentrated in an area above
the ceiling, over the wall that divides the cockpit from the
first-class cabin.
 
 
   Jim Harris, a spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board,
said that the forward area, the area that is of the greatest
interest to investigators, is also the most badly shattered,
apparently having hit first. The investigators recently identified
wiring from the entertainment system as being heat-damaged and
coming from that area over the wall.
 
 
   The plane crashed on Sept. 2, on a flight from Kennedy
International Airport in New York to Switzerland, killing all 229
people aboard. The pilots had reported smoke in the cockpit 16
minutes before the crash. Investigators have avoided using the word
``fire,'' saying instead that components are heat-damaged.
 

 
   The system was designed and manufactured by Interactive Flight
Technologies of Phoenix, a company that subsequently got out of the
business because it could not make additional sales. A spokeswoman,
Marsha Malone, said Thursday that she could not give any
information about the system installed on the Swissair planes.
 
 
   Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, said his agency had inspected
one Swissair MD-11, concentrating on the wiring in the forward part
of the plane, including the entertainment system, and that Swissair
itself had inspected three more that were undergoing maintenance.
No safety problems were found on any of the planes, he said. He
added that the inspections were ``in areas that were readily
accessible, where we didn't have to take anything apart.''
 
 
   He said that the FAA was re-examining the design and
installation of the system on the Swissair planes, but that the
agency had not asked any other airlines to inspect their
entertainment systems.
 
 
   Such systems are a major point of competition among airlines
offering first-class or business-class service over long routes.
They can require large amounts of electric current, and thus
generate substantial heat. David Sebring, the chief engineer for
cabin systems at Boeing Co., said in an interview in August that on
a big jet the system can use 30 kilowatts _ enough electricity to
run several large suburban houses.
