   CAIRO _ The Taliban movement in Afghanistan might consider
putting Osama bin Laden on trial for a 1996 bomb attack that killed
19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia, a leading Saudi-owned newspaper
reported Wednesday.
 
 
   Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant who lives in
Afghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that and
other attacks on Americans, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two
U.S. Embassies in Africa. He has been indicted in the United
States, charged with terrorist acts committed before the embassy
bombings.
 
 
   But efforts to bring bin Laden to justice have been hamstrung by
the fact that the Taliban, which control most of Afghanistan, is a
militant Islamic movement whose leaders who have said they will not
hand him over to the United States or to anyone else.
 
 
   The report, in the London-based newspaper Al Hayat, that the
Taliban might consider trying bin Laden themselves could not be
independently confirmed. A senior Taliban diplomat reached by
telephone in Pakistan dismissed it as ``baseless.''
 
 
   But Al Hayat is generally a reliable source on matters involving
the Saudi government, and it reported that the Taliban had
communicated the offer to Saudi Arabia as a good-will gesture.
 
 
   If it is true, the report would suggest that the Taliban might
at least be reconsidering their position on bin Laden, which has
deeply complicated its relations with the West and with Saudi
Arabia, one of only three countries in the world to recognize the
militant movement as Afghanistan's legitimate government.
 
 
   Saudi Arabia has never charged bin Laden or anyone else in the
1996 bombing, and any specific American accusations linking bin
Laden to that attack have been spelled out only in a sealed
indictment. But U.S. officials have said they have learned enough
about the bombing, of an American military compound in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran, to regard bin Laden as a prime suspect.
 
 
   Saudi Arabia, which stripped bin Laden of his citizenship in
1994 because of his militant activities, has turned up pressure
against Afghanistan in a clear show of protest at the sanctuary
provided there to him.
 
 
   Last month, it expelled the Afghan charge d'affaires and
recalled its own top envoy from Kabul, the Afghan capital, saying
that the moves were ``in keeping with national interest.''
