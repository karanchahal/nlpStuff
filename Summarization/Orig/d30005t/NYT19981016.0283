   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ In a rare public statement about the
August bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the FBI said
Friday that two vehicles had been used in the attack on the embassy
here.
 
 
   The FBI also indicated that it had learned the identities of new
suspects in the blast here, and that they are at large. They were
in a Suzuki Samurai, one of the two vehicles identified Friday,
investigators said.
 
 
   Two vehicles were also used in the bombing of the embassy in
Nairobi, according to indictments that have been handed down. One
carried the bomb, the other guided the first vehicle through the
streets of Nairobi to the embassy. Investigators are pursuing the
theory that the modus operandi was the same here.
 
 
   One of the vehicles used in the blast here was an Atlas
refrigeration truck made by Nissan, with a silver-colored cargo box
and white or beige cab, the FBI and the Tanzania Criminal
Investigation Division said at a news conference Friday afternoon.
 
 
   This was the vehicle that investigators now believe carried the
bomb, which killed 11 people and wounded at least 86. The driver of
the vehicle, who has not been identified, died in the attack,
according to investigators.
 
 
   The simultaneous blast in Nairobi killed more than 250,
including 12 Americans. Three people have been indicted in New York
in connection with the attacks, which the Clinton administration
has charged were masterminded by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
who lives in Afghanistan.
 
 
   Friday's development should put to rest earlier reports that a
water tanker, which regularly delivered water to the embassy here,
had carried the bomb, an investigator said.
 
 
   The refrigeration truck followed the water tanker into the
compound, according to a U.S. security official.
 
 
   It is not known how the refrigeration truck, a 1987 Nissan,
penetrated the embassy compound here without being adequately
searched. At Friday's news conference, FBI Agent Ken Maxwell read a
brief statement and declined to take any questions. The head of
Tanzania's Criminal Investigation Division, Adadi Rajabu, read a
similar statement in Swahili, and also declined to take questions.
 
 
   The second vehicle was a Suzuki Samurai, a small jeep popular in
East Africa. It had been ``utilized by suspects thus far
identified,'' Maxwell said. He did not say how it had been used or
who the suspects were.
 
 
   Tanzania has charged two men in connection with the bombing,
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed.
 
 
   For reasons that are not clear, the Clinton administration has
not sought to extradite either of these men, even though it has
brought other suspects back to the United States, where they have
been indicted. A diplomat here said the United States did not
consider the evidence against Ahmed to be very strong.
 
 
   Since the bombings, the FBI and their counterparts here and in
Kenya have made few public statements.
 
 
   Friday's news conference was for the purpose of issuing an
appeal to the Tanzanian public to come forth with any information
about the vehicles, an indication that while the investigators feel
they have made ``a significant amount of progress,'' as Maxwell
said Friday, they are also stymied.
