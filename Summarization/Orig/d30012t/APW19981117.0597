	   DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought high
ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular
celestial fireworks in 33 years, after enjoying a low-key preview
Monday night.
	   The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in its
entire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and into
early Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display of
falling stars too numerous to wish upon.
	   Sky-watchers will get a final chance at the big show Wednesday
night, after which sporadic showers may be visible for several
days.
	   The front-row seats were expected to be wherever the sky was
darkest and clearest _ from the Mongolian steppes to the mountains
of northern Thailand to U.S. research planes breaking through cloud
cover over Okinawa, Japan.
	   For millions of others _ those befogged by weather or living in
North America, when the spectacle was to reach its peak at midday,
the worst time for viewing _ the Internet was the place to be.
	   In northern Thailand, hotels, camp grounds and airlines were
booked solid with people expected to head to Doi Inthanon, the
Southeast Asian country's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464
feet).
	   For those who went up Monday night, the streaking star-fall came
into view at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday (1830 GMT Monday) to a chorus
of ``oohs'' and ``aahs,'' and 33-year-old Thamarong Kudpong made
his wish: ``I already have a daughter. Now, I would like a son.''
	   Many in Japan were wishing Tuesday for the weather to clear. The
government called on public offices and private businesses in the
cities to turn off their lights to enhance viewing possibilities.
	   In Thailand, police anticipated a rush out of Bangkok, the
smog-ceilinged capital, by people looking for a clearer view.
Alternative traffic routes were posted to avoid worsening evening
rush hour.
	   Officials in the capital ordered all public parks closed Tuesday
night for fear that hordes of stargazers would not be safe in the
dark, said a local television station.
	   At least one member of the Thai royal family, Princess
Sirindhorn, was traveling to a rural eastern province to observe
the show, ITV also reported.
	   The celestial fireworks are actually the long tail of the Comet
Tempel-Tuttle. The shower is nicknamed Leonids because ancient
observers thought the meteors came from the constellation Leo.
	   It occurs every November, usually with little fanfare. But every
33 years, the comet speeds through the inner solar system and sheds
swarms of particles as it nears the sun. In 1966, the Leonids
display peaked at 150,000 meteors per hour.
	   Earth plows straight through the comet's wake as it traces its
own orbit. The shower of ``falling stars'' is actually the glowing
contrails of comet dust, or meteoroids.
	   Many of the world's 600-plus satellites have been maneuvered to
reduce the possibility of damage from the speeding grit, which can
poke holes in solar panels, pit lenses, blast away mirror coatings
or cause damaging electromagnetic pulses.
	   Russian space authorities said the crew of the Mir space
stations was prepared for a too-close encounter and would enter the
Soyuz escape capsule when the shower is at its peak.
	   ``It is better to be on the safe side,'' Deputy Mission Control
chief Viktor Blagov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   In Romania, the Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a
front-page headline: ``Romanians, Stay Inside! Leonide, the
Toughest Meteor Rain.''
