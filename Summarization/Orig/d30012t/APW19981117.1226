	   Whether they stood on the tallest mountain in Thailand or the
desert in California, tens of thousands of people were searching
the skies for a glimpse of the biggest meteor shower in decades.

	   Clouds interfered with the view from many sites, but many
stargazers were rewarded with a spectacular view of meteors
streaking through the skies in blazes of red and white as the
Leonid meteor shower reached its climax early Wednesday in Asia.

	   The shower, which peaks every 33 years, is caused by the Earth's
passage through the long tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The
storm, which began Monday, got its name because it appears to come
from the direction of the constellation Leo.

	   The biggest crowds gathered in Asia, which was best positioned
for viewing the climax, but the spectacle was seen throughout the
globe _ weather permitting.

	   In Tokyo and many other Asian cities, public offices and private
businesses turned off their lights to enhance viewing. Though the
night remained bright in the Tokyo area, meteors could be seen
streaking across the skies every two or three minutes at the peak
of the storm.

	   ``I only wish I could think up wishes faster,'' said Ikue Oe, a
housewife watching the storm with her husband in the Tokyo suburb
of Yokohama.

	   Tens of thousands of tourists swarmed to Doi Inthanon,
Thailand's highest peak at 2,565 meters (8,464 feet), and Doi
Suthep, another mountain with a famed Buddhist temple on top.

	   People shrieked and squealed with delight as they glimpsed the
night's first shooting star at almost exactly 1 a.m. Wednesday
(1800 GMT Tuesday). But their enjoyment was tempered by the sight
of clouds moving in.

	   Officials said 10,000 people had passed through the national
park's gates by 7:30 p.m. Tuesday (1230 GMT), seven hours before
the anticipated peak of the promised celestial spectacle.

	   People huddled in blankets drove in, paid the 20 baht (55 U.S.
cents) entrance fee and continued up the mountain, scouting for
suitable viewing spots and turning the park into a tent city. The
mountain's actual peak was reserved for dignitaries and scientists.

	   The crowds that gathered at sites in the Mojave Desert in
California were smaller but no less enthusiastic.

	   The desert's campgrounds, normally empty on November weeknights,
were jammed with dozens of stargazers in the early morning hours,
many peering through telescopes and whooping and hollering with
each dazzling display from the Leonid meteor shower.

	   Sandra Macika, 36, of San Jose saw about 30 meteors as she
watched the skies from Mercy Hot Springs, about 30 miles (50
kilometers) south of Los Banos.

	   ``I could see in front of me big streaks of light falling on the
highway,'' she said.

	   Most Australians who rose early Wednesday were disappointed to
find storm clouds blocking the rare display of celestial fireworks.

	   Sydney Observatory astronomy curator Nick Lomb said that while
some astronomers at Parkes Observatory, in northwestern New South
Wales, had seen fireballs through the clouds, it was not the meteor
storm they had hoped for.

	   The view apparently was clearer in Norway, where rescuers were
swamped with calls from people who spotted what they thought were
red distress flares fired from ships in trouble off the southern
coast.
	   ``The meteors really changed color, and sometimes they were
bright red, so I can understand that people associated them with
distress rockets,'' said rescue leader Ben Vikoeren.
